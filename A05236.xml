            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Hee tooke his wife his children and friendes, and departed at all aduenture in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to diuers places, where he found fortune ſo good and happy that by armes and ſtrength he made himſelfe king of many diuerſe Realmes, which hee departed vnto his chlldren, and commiſed and ordained certaine eſpies to eſpie and waite, if his brother <hi>Saturne</hi> married himſelfe, and if his wife brought foorth men children, and whether hée put them to death. During theſe ſaide things, <hi>Saturne</hi> dwelled with his mother and his ſiſters <hi>Cibell</hi> and <hi>Ceres,</hi> and beganne to raigne with ſo great magnificence, that they of the countrie ſéeing their neighbours by them did make and ordaine Kings to raigne on them, of ſuch as were noble and vertuous: aſſembled togither on a day, and made <hi>Saturne</hi> King ouer them, and vppon their lines, and crowned him with great glorie, with a crowne of Lawyer, with great ioy. <hi>Saturne</hi> anon tooke and accepted this royall honour and worſhip, and tooke the ſcepter in his hand, and here the crowne on his head, and raigned wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, inducing his people to liue honeſtly, and to loue ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and ordained a naked ſword to be borne afore him, in ſigne of iuſtice. He did iuſtice on malefactours, and enhaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them that were good, hee did build a Citie, which he
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:7118:11"/>
named <hi>Crete,</hi> becauſe the Ile bare the ſaide name, and hee was the firſt inhabitour and dweller. When he had founded the Citie, he ordained his Pallace and dwelling place in the middle thereof, in example, as the heart is in the middes of the bodie, to miniſter to the members, ſo hée would inſtruct and gouerne his people. And after this, he choſe an hundred and foure wiſe men, which hee inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and ordained counſellours and gouernours of his Realme. And then they of <hi>Crete</hi> ſéeing the right great wiſedome of their king, aſſembled togither diuers times, and named him a god: and yet more, they founded vnto him a Temple, an Alter and an Idole, bearing in the one hand a ſickle, in ſignification that hee deſtroyed the vices, in ſuch wiſe as the fickle cutteth hearbs and deſtroyeth the wéedes: and in the other hand he held a ſerpent, that did bite his taile, foraſmuch as <hi>Saturn</hi> ſaid, that euery man ſhuld bite the taile of the ſerpent, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is to ſay, that euery man ſhould feare and flée the euill end: For the end oftentimes is vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, as the taile of a Serpent: and that appeareth yet daily by the ende of many euill diſpoſed and inuenomed men.</p>

The Poets by this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, compared the world at this time to gold, which is moſt pretious of al metals: wherfore many men ſay, that <hi>Saturne</hi> was the firſt man that found the maner to melt mettall, and to affine gold, and made his veſſell, &amp; vtenſilles of his houſe, of diuers mettal. And vnder this colour, they figured at that time, the worlde to be of gold. Then began the men by the doctrine of <hi>Saturne</hi> to vſe and were gold, to myne the rocks, to pearce the mountains perillous, to haunt the thorny de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarts, to fight &amp; aduance the orguillous ſerpents, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fierce dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deadly griffons, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrous beaſts, &amp; to ſpred abroad their worldly engins.

He was ſtrong and hardie, he had no feare nor doubt of any Serpent of the mountaine, nor any monſter of deſart, or of beaſt dwelling in caues.

angry with his anger. He was in ſhort time ſo greatly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed, and impreſſed with ſo eager impreſſon of ſorrow, that his face was like vnto Aſhes, or as he had bee dead al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: and after many thoughts, he opened his mouth, and ſpake ſoftly thus: I ſlea my ſelfe by melancholy, and am a man greatly abuſed: I haue made an oath vnto my brother <hi>Titan,</hi> that I ſhal put all my children male to death, that ſhal come of my fleſh. Peraduenture the gods wold not ſuffer that I ſhalbe forſworne: and haue let me haue knowledge by my god <hi>Apollo,</hi> that my wife hath conceiued a ſonne that ſhall put me out of my Realme, to the end that I ſhould ſlea him: foraſmuch as I had concluded in my ſelfe, to haue broken mine oath, and haue ſpared the liues of my children. And ſince it is ſo, I ſhall no longer ſpare them: if it happen that my ſonne be borne a liue, certaine he ſhall be put to death: for it is better that he die a childe, then he ſhould waxe a man, and waxe rebell againſt me, and enhaunce himſelf aboue me, by his malice, inſurrection, or otherwiſe.</p>
                     <p>In this will and reſolution, this ſorrowful <hi>Saturne</hi> retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into his houſe, continuing in this eſtate, and ſorrowfull ſighs, &amp; melancholious fantaſies, in ſuch wiſe that <hi>Cibel</hi> durſt not come into his preſence, nor could not get of him a ioyous ſight: wherefore he got him a ſurname of ſorrow, and was named <hi>Saturne,</hi> the triſte, or ſorrowfull. And it was ſo, that when he had bin in his houſe a certain ſpace, and ſaw the day approch that his wife ſhould be deliuered of child, for to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute his ſorowful courage, he called his wife and ſaid: Dame it is ſo apparant, that ſhortly thou ſhalt be deliuered of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fruit of thy wombe: if thou be deliuered of a ſonne, I commaund thée vpon pain of death, that thou ſlea him, and that thou ſend me his heart. And when <hi>Cibell</hi> heard theſe wordes, and this rigorous and vnnaturall violence and will, anon ſhe fell to the ground in a ſowne, for her legs failed her. And in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeuing of the ſowne, ſhee knéeled before the féete of <hi>Saturne,</hi> and ſaid on this wiſe. Sir, haſt thou no ſhame, that wilt bee huſband of a woman murdering her owne child: I thée re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:7118:15"/>
of mercy and grace, beſéeching thée to haue regard, that I am thy wife, and haue the heart of a woman, and not of a tyrant, or a murtherer. Dame (anſwered <hi>Saturne</hi>) require me no more of things touching this matter: it is iudged by a foreſéene and counterpeyſed ſentence, that if thou haue a ſon, he ſhall bee dead: for I haue promiſed and ſworne ſo to my brother <hi>Titan:</hi> and aboue this, I haue anſwere of the god <hi>Apollo,</hi> that in thy wombe is a ſonne, that ſhall caſt me out of this realme: and therefore, ſée that at his birth he be dead, as deare as thou loueſt thy life: and alſo, as I haue ſaid, ſend me his heart medled with wine, that I may drinke it. And how ſir, anſwered <hi>Cibell,</hi> knoweſt thou not that I am a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and by proper and ſingular inclination, I haue a verie loue to ſmall children, and muſt giue them to eate, and ſuck? O wéeneſt thou that I haue an heart ſo hard, as for to foile my hands with the blood of my ſon? I pray and require thée, to reuoke thy ſentence, and be pitious to thy wife and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Thou art wiſe after the iudgement of thy people. In this partie, thou ſheweſt thy ſelfe not good: for by thy oath thou art not bounden, nor holden to ſlea thy ſonne, ſéeing it is truth, that all oathes made agaynſt good maners, ought not to be holden. For to ſlea thy ſonne, it is a villaine caſe, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to honour, reaſon, pittie, equitie, and iuſtice. It is ſinne againſt nature, agaynſt vertue, and againſt all good maners. Then, thy oath for to ſlea thy ſonne is nought, and thou ough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt anull it: thou art king, and that vpon paine of death for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viddeſt thy people to make murther, or homicide. By this thou that art myrrour &amp; example to other, oughteſt to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and appeaſe thy ſelfe. And me ſéemeth on that other ſide, that thou interpreteſt, and conſtrueſt euill, the ſentence of god <hi>Apollo,</hi> ſaying, that I haue in my wombe a ſonne, that ſhall put thée out of thy kingdome, For by this, it ought to be vnderſtand, that the ſonne that I beare, ſhall ouerliue thée, and put thée ſo out of thy kingdome, that is to ſay, into thy Sepulchre, the day that thou ſhalt depart out of this worlde. And if this may not appeaſe thée: if it ſo happen that I haue a

                     <p>
                        <hi>Saturn</hi> had then the heart paſſing great, that for ſemblable compaſſion, <hi>Veſca</hi> the mother, <hi>Cibell</hi> and <hi>Ceres,</hi> wept, and gaue out great plentie of teares, and in like wiſe all the aſſiſtants that were in the place, wept out of meaſure aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly: yet neuertheleſſe it might not ſoft nor attemper the hard commaundement of king <hi>Saturne.</hi> But in concluſion, he ſayd to <hi>Cibell,</hi> that ſhe ſhould no more procure the reſpite of the life of his ſon, but he ſhould be dead, and ſhe alſo with him, if ſhe did not his commaundement. With ſorrowfull concluſion <hi>Cibell</hi> departed from thence, all in a traunce halfe dead, and caſting abroade her armes and hands, with great exceſſe of teares, that ran like a riuer from her tender eyen, entred into a Tower, her mother that deſolate Ladie fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing her. She being in her chamber for fruſhed, and all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempered with ſorrow, began to trauell anon, &amp; was deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of a daughter, and of a ſon. The daughter was borne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſonne, and was ſent by <hi>Ceres,</hi> and borne to nouriſh into the Citie of <hi>Parthenie,</hi> and was named <hi>Iuno:</hi> and the ſon began to laugh at comming out of his mothers wombe, and was named <hi>Iupiter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When <hi>Cibell</hi> and <hi>Veſca,</hi> ſawe the childe laugh, their teares began to grow double, and they had not taken great regard and héed to the child, what time <hi>Cibell</hi> all angrie and corrupt with wanhope, with a ſigh and féeble ſpirite ſaid to her mother: Ha, my mother, what pitious caſe ſhall this bée now? giue me a ſharpe cutting knife, and I ſhall murther my ſonne, by vnnaturall errour againſt my will. And after this villainous déed, for my abſolution of the great ſinne, I ſhall murther my ſelfe alſo. And this is my full purpoſe: for, after ſo cruell a déede and worke, notwithſtanding any excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, I neuer will longer liue. The mother of <hi>Cibell</hi> was then al bewept and greatly diſmaid, when ſhe heard the aire of the tender mouth of her daughter redound in her eares, of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:7118:16"/>
ſo hard a crueltie: ſhe being all afraid, ſaid to her, my daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter what thinkſt thou to do? art thou enraged out of thy wit, or fooliſh? My mother, anſwered <hi>Cibell,</hi> yea verily, I am verily as you ſay, enraged out of my wit, and fooliſh, and yet more I am furious woode. Make me no longer to languiſh. Giue me the curſed mortall knife, forged in an euill houre, for of force I muſt obey the king <hi>Saturne,</hi> your right welbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued ſonne, my right redoubted huſband, that hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement ouer me, and will ſhamefully put me to death, if I accompliſh not, and fulfill his commaundement in the death of his ſonne, which he hath charged me to ſlea.</p>
                     <p>Anon, as <hi>Veſca</hi> conſidered that her daughter ſayd, and in the errour that ſhe was in, ſhe tooke the child that was in her armes, and plucked it from her by force, and alway the childe laughed. When <hi>Cibell</hi> ſawe her ſonne in the armes of her mother, as a woman enraged and out of her wit, ſhée began to crie, that ſhe ſhould ſlea the childe, or giue it her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine; or elſe ſhe would ariſe out of her bed, and go and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine to king <hi>Saturne.</hi> After theſe wordes, <hi>Veſca</hi> deliuered the child to a Damoſell of the houſe, that onely was there with them, and bade her, that ſhe ſhould go ſlea the childe in the preſence of <hi>Saturne,</hi> or in ſome other place out of theyr ſight: the poore damoſell excuſed her, and <hi>Veſca</hi> gaue her in commandement, and charged her with great menaces, that ſhe ſhould go forth and take the child, and the knife, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ea it. And ſo by the commaundement of theſe two Ladyes, ſhee tooke the knife many times, &amp; put it to the throte of the childe, for to cut it aſunder, and alway the noble childe laughed at the knife. And when the damoſell ſaw this, that it was inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, ſhe might not find in her heart to do it any harme. In this ſorrow, and and in this pain and vexation, <hi>Veſca, Cibel,</hi> and the damoſell were a long time. Now they iudged him to death and put the knife to his throte: and ſuddainly the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell reuoked it, and ſware that ſhe would neuer be perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutreſſe of one to fayre a childe. And thus they began all thrée to wéepe and ſobbe, bewailing the childe, by ſo great affection
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:7118:16"/>
that it was pitie to heare. After this, when they had long wept and ſobbed, and bewayled the tender wéeping and paine of <hi>Cibell,</hi> they beganne a little to pacifie their hearts and began to returne to motherly pitie. <hi>Cibell</hi> called her that held the child, and required her pitiouſly, that ſhe would giue her her ſonne, to kiſſe and hold in her armes, promiſing that ſhe would do him no harme. The Damoſell that wiſt not what ſhould fall, deliuered her her tender childe: and then when <hi>Cibell</hi> beheld her childe, with her face all bewept, and all diſtempered with teares, ſhe kiſſed his laughing mouth, more then an C. times, &amp; came againe to her nature, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging her ſinne, and began to ſay. My child, I had bin well infortunate, if I had taken thy life from thée.

all new, and ſate downe on the bed ſide where her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter lay. There they two began to ſpeake togither of <hi>Saturn,</hi> &amp; of the fortune of this childe, and that hee had béene in great aduenture: and promiſed the one vnto the other, that they would ſaue the childe, vnto their power. After this promiſe, in the ende of diuerſe purpoſes, they concluded to ſend this child ſecretly vnto the two daughters of king <hi>Melliſeus,</hi> the which <hi>Veſca</hi> had nouriſhed in her yong age. Of theſe two daughters, the one was named <hi>Almachee,</hi> and the other <hi>Melliſee.</hi> This concluſion fully finiſhed and taken, <hi>Veſca</hi> lapped and wound the childe as it ought to be, and deliuered it vnto a damoſell being there preſent, with all things, &amp; gaue her charge to bear it ſecretly to <hi>Almachee,</hi> &amp; <hi>Melliſee.</hi> The good damoſel enterpriſed the ſaid charge, and departed out of <hi>Crete</hi> with the child at al aduenture, &amp; ſo worſhipfully gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded her, that ſhe brought the child liuing in ſafetie to the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of <hi>Oſon:</hi> which ſhe preſented to <hi>Almachee</hi> and <hi>Melliſee,</hi> rehearſing how <hi>Veſca</hi> had ſent him to them, for the great loue and truſt that ſhe had in them, and how <hi>Saturn</hi> had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded that his mother ſhould flea it.</p>
                     <p>Anone, as theſe two damoſels ſawe the childe, and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode how <hi>Saturne</hi> had iudged it to death, they receyued it with pitie, and in fauour of <hi>Veſca,</hi> promiſed to nouriſh it in the ſecreteſt and beſt wiſe that they mought, And forthwith the ſame houre they bare the childe vnto a mountaine that was nigh to the Citie, wherein dwelled their nourſe in a déepe hole of a caue, which was richly entailed, and carued with Chiſell and other diuerſe inſtruments. And then they ſent againe the Damoſell that brought the child into <hi>Crete.</hi> In this maner was the life of the childe ſaued. <hi>Almachee</hi> and <hi>Melliſe</hi> nouriſhed the child with the milk of a goat. Fortune was to him more propice and helping the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nature. What ſhall I ſay, in the beginning when he was put in the caue, as his nurſe on a day ſawe him wéepe and crie by his proper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of chilhoode, becauſe hee ſhould not be heard, they tooke Trumpets, Timpanes, and nimbals, and made them to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:7118:17"/>
ſownd ſo greatly, that a great multitude of Bées fléeing about the mountaine heard their ſound, and with this ſownd entred into the caue, and tooke an hole by the childe, flying about him without any greefe or harme doing to the childe: and yet more, they made there honie, whereof the childe did eate and was nouriſhed from thence forth, which was a maruailous thing. And for to atchieue the matter, beginning at the damoſell that had borne this childe thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: when ſhe came againe, ſhee rehearſed to dame <hi>Cibell</hi> and <hi>Veſca,</hi> all her dooing and worke, and gaue them a right great comfort touching the childe. Then the two Ladies, by méere deliberatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tooke an Abeſt, which is a precious ſtone, and brayed it into pouder, and after that they mingled it with wine in a cup of gold, and dame <hi>Veſca</hi> bare it to her ſon <hi>Saturne,</hi> and ſhe abounding in bitter teares all bewept, ſaid vnto him: My ſonne, thy wife hath ſent to thée this drinke, know thou verely that ſhe this day hath rendred and yéelden the fruit of her wombe, a ſon and a daughter: ſhe hath ſent the daughter to nouriſh in the Citie of <hi>Parthenie:</hi> but in the obeying of thy ſtraight commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, we haue defeated thy ſon, and put him to death. Of whom the body, the fleſh, and the little tender bones be now turned into aſhes, &amp; ſhe hath ſent here to thee, the right noble hart tempred in wine: which I preſent to thée, to the end that thou do thy pleaſure, and be no more in doubt by thy ſon to be put out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> realme,</p>
                     <p>Anon as <hi>Saturne</hi> heard the pittious wordes of his mother, vnderſtanding the newe tidings that ſhee ſaide and ſhewed him, he beganne to frowne, and ſayde in this manner. O pittie without pittie: ought not my heart bee terrible angrie, and reſtrained with preſſours of ſorrow, whan it is force of that to mine hart this preſent heart, iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of his blood and rootes, be giuen in meate &amp; paſture, for to ſtaunche the diſconuenable hunger of mine vnhoneſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire. Theſe wordes accompliſhed, <hi>Saturne</hi> was greatly diſpleaſed and full of renewing of ſorrow, dranke the drinke, wéening that it had béene as his mother had done
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:7118:18"/>
him to vnderſtand: and after went into his chamber, and there beganne to bee greatly in melancholie: and after that, forth on he purpoſed and trowed to abſtaine himſelfe to pay his wife the dew debt of marriage. But as there is no ſorrow that ouerpaſſeth not by ſpace of time, he forgat this ſorrow, &amp; lying with his wife, engendred another ſon, which ſhe ſaued like as <hi>Iupiter</hi> was ſaued (notwithſtanding that <hi>Saturn</hi> charged her to put him to death) and this child was caried to <hi>Athenes,</hi> where he was kept and nouriſhed and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Nepune.</hi> Yet after this he lay with his wife, and engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred another ſon and a daughter, which at time conuenable were borne, and departed from their mother: but at this time ſhe tolde not of her ſon, but hid it from <hi>Saturne:</hi> which ſonne was named <hi>Pluto,</hi> and ſhe did it to keepe in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> that afterward was named hel. And for to content her huſband <hi>Saturne,</hi> when ſhee was deliuered of theſe two children, ſhe ſent to him her daughter, which was called <hi>Galanta,</hi> and ſhe died in her tender yeares. And thus of all theſe generations, <hi>Saturne</hi> ſuppoſed that none had béene reſerued but <hi>Iuno</hi> his daughter, whome he went of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes to viſite in <hi>Parthenie,</hi> where he did it to be nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with many noble virgins of her age, and alſo many ancient gntlewomen, to induce and teach them gentleneſſe and vertue. But of all them I will a while tarrie nowe, and alſo of <hi>Iupiter, Neptune,</hi> and <hi>Pluto.</hi> And now I will ſhew how <hi>Dardanus</hi> put his brother <hi>Iaſius</hi> to death, for co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetouſneſſe to raigne in the Citie of <hi>Corinth:</hi> and how he departed out of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and how he ſet the firſt ſtone in the Citie of <hi>Dardane,</hi> which afterward was named <hi>Troy.</hi>

V. ¶Howe after the death of King <hi>Corinthus</hi> of Corinth, his two ſonnes, <hi>Dardanus</hi> and <hi>Iaſius,</hi> ſtroue who of them ſhould haue the kingdome: and how <hi>Dardanus</hi> ſlue his brother <hi>Iaſius</hi> by treaſon, wherefore hee muſt depart out of the countrey.</head>
                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this time when <hi>Crete</hi> began to bee a Realme, and a kingdome, and was in poſſeſſion of their firſt king, the ſame time in the Citie of <hi>Corinth</hi> which ſtand in <hi>Naples,</hi> reigned <hi>Corinthus</hi> their firſt king: and <hi>Corinthus</hi> had to his wife one of the daughters of king <hi>Atlas</hi> of <hi>Libie,</hi> named <hi>Electra.</hi> They reigned togither and atchieued proſperouſly their life: they left after them two ſonnes, whereof the one was named <hi>Dardanus,</hi> and that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Iaſius.</hi> Some ſay that this <hi>Dardanus</hi> was ſonne to <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter:</hi> but <hi>Boccace</hi> trowed he was lawfull ſonne of <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus</hi> (as it appeareth in the ſixt booke of the genealogie of gods) <hi>Dardanus</hi> then and <hi>Iaſius,</hi> (after the death of their father <hi>Corinthus,</hi> and of their mother <hi>Electra</hi>) woulde ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céed in the realmes, and in no wiſe they could accord. <hi>Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danus</hi> had a high and hautie courage, and <hi>Iaſius</hi> in likewiſe. They argued and ſtroue togither, the one againſt the other, oftentimes of this matter, and conſpired and made ſecret me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſes vnder couert, in ſuch wiſe that <hi>Dardanus</hi> on a day aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled all the people that he could get, for to deſtroy his brother <hi>Iaſius,</hi> and his friends were then aſſembled in a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret place, for to treate the peace, and to ſée how they might content and pleaſe <hi>Dardanus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Whan <hi>Iaſius</hi> ſawe his brother come all in armes, all his bloud beganne to change, and ſéeing that his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was mooued and full of euill will, déeming that
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:7118:19"/>
this matter ſhould turne to great miſchiefe, he cried and ſaid: Alas, what auaileth for to ſpeake and counſaile, and ſéeke meanes of peace betwéene my brother and me: we be betrayed, lo héere is my brother that commeth vpon vs all in armes, each man ſaue himſelfe that may. With theſe wordes <hi>Dardanus</hi> came in to the conſiſtorie, ſmote his brother vnto death, and ſaid: <hi>Iaſius,</hi> thou maiſt not abſtaine thy ſelfe from thy imaginations: Thou haſt enhaunſed thy ſelfe againſt me, but now I ſhall make an end of thée. <hi>Iaſius</hi> fell downe dead among the feete of his friendes, and their cloths were all beſprent and be-bled with his bloud. When the friendes of <hi>Iaſius</hi> ſawe this tyranny, they ſaued them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues as well as they could to their power, and fled from thence all enraged. Then <hi>Dardanus</hi> returned to the royall Pallace, and the friendes of <hi>Iaſius</hi> gathered them, and went to armes, and made a noyſe, and murmur ſo great, that in little ſpace all the Citie was ſtrangely troubled for the death of <hi>Iaſius,</hi> which was greatly in the grace and fauour of all the people of <hi>Corinth.</hi> For when they had rehearſed the death of <hi>Iaſius,</hi> they tooke great ſorrow, and menaced <hi>Dardanus</hi> to death. And forthwith in effect they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled by great routs in the ſtréetes, and ſaid one to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Alas now is dead the loue of <hi>Corinthus,</hi> that had more amitie and loue to the common weale then <hi>Dardanus:</hi> Let vs go and auenge his death: Go wee and puniſh the male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factour; let vs no longer tarrie: we ſhall do a meritorie worke. Who that euer doth iniuſtice and tyranny, is not worthie to be chiefe and head of clemencie, nor of iuſtice. If we ſuffer a murderer to raigne ouer vs, neuer ſhall there good come thereof. Where the head is ſicke and euill the members may not bee whole nor good. <hi>Dardanus</hi> hath ſlaine his Brother <hi>Iaſius</hi> wrongfully. It is verie like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, that hee ſhall ſlea vs after his will. Let vs take from him his puiſſance, and let vs ſhew that we be men, deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of vice and enemies vnto all them that ſéeke and engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der tyranny in their courages.</p>
                     <p>Such were the clamours of the <hi>Corinthians:</hi> by ſuch
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:7118:19"/>
noyſe and ſemblable clamours, they chafed themſelues, and in the end aſſembled in one place, and were of ardent appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, to correct the malefactour <hi>Dardanus,</hi> and his complices. In this tempeſt and ſwelling furour, they went to the Pallace where <hi>Dardanus</hi> had put himſelfe for refuge, but they founde the gates ſhutte, and could not enter into it: wherefore they beſieged the place making a great noyſe, and ſo great ſtirre, that <hi>Dardanus</hi> was abaſhed, and anon hee aſſembled his friendes and aſked them their counſell. They anſwered and ſaid, that he and they were in great aduenture and perill, and that the people ſo mooued, might not lightly be appeaſed, and for this they ſaid to him: ſaue thy ſelfe, and vs alſo with thée: Thou haſt ſlaine thy brother <hi>Iaſius,</hi> whom the people loued maruailouſly for his benignitie? the treſpaſſe is great, ſéeing it is ſo doone, the beſt way ought to be taken: we counſell thée that thou leaue this Pallace, and finde manner to iſſue out, and wee ſhall follow thée, and go with thée, and ſearch our aduentures in other lands: for it ſhall be great paine, by poſſibilitie, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to content and appeaſe this people: For it is ſo, that the <hi>Corinthians</hi> be terrible to all men that they haue inhate and in deſpight.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Dardanus</hi> hearing theſe wordes, beganne to ſigh, and conſidering that hee muſt depart from his Citie by his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>déede, fault, and deſert, hee ſmote himſelfe on the breſt and ſaide: Ha fortune vnſtedfaſt, what is mee befall? My hands be foule and filthie, with the bloud of my lawfull bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The inſurrcetion, and the rebellion of my people, han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging before mine eies, it is force that I flée for to ſaue my life, and purpoſe to liue of rauin and theft. What miſchance? what euill happe is this? Since it is ſo, I yéeld me fugitiſe, and ſhall go my way, at all aduentures be it. When the friendes of <hi>Dardanus</hi> had vnderſtoode that hee was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded and purpoſed to ſaue his life, they ioyned to him, and appointed togither that the next morning, in the firſt breaking of the day, they would departe from the Pallace,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:7118:20"/>
and take the aduenture to paſſe by their enemies, ſaying, that if they might eſcape, they would go to the riuage of the ſea, and take the kings barge. And all they ſware to helpe and companie each other vnto the death. The night paſſed, the day appeared, and then <hi>Dardanus</hi> that had not reſted that night to his pleaſure, but had watched with his armed men, and were readie to take the aduenture that the gods and fortune would giue and ſend them, iſſued out of the pallace, and found the moſt part of his enemies aſleepe: he thruſted among the villaines, and paſſed forth with little reſiſtance (that notwithſtanding, the waking <hi>Corinthians</hi>) he came to his royall ſhip, and tooke the ſea, and ſaued him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, whereof the <hi>Corinthians</hi> had great ſorrow.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Dardanus</hi> ſawe that he was ſo quit of the fauour of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> he went ſailing by the ſea, and land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed firſt at the port of the Citie of <hi>Samos,</hi> being in <hi>Thrace,</hi> &amp; there vitailed him, and went to ſea againe, and arriued in <hi>Aſia,</hi> in a quarter where the land was ioyning to the ſea of <hi>Helleſpont:</hi> And finding this land right good and fruitful for to enhabite, he made there his habitation, and there ſet the firſt ſtone of a right great citie that he beganne, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter finiſhed. This Citie was that time named <hi>Dardane,</hi> after the name of <hi>Dardanus,</hi> but afterward it was called <hi>Troy. Dardanus</hi> peopled and filled his Citie with men and women, which he gate by ſwéeteneſſe and faire promiſes And the other part he conquered by force, theft and pillage. He made himſelfe king of <hi>Dardane,</hi> and ditched the Cittie about with great ditches. After lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g time he paſſed out of this world, and left a ſonne of his wife <hi>Candama,</hi> that was ſecond king of <hi>Dardane.</hi> This king was named <hi>Erutonius,</hi> and raigned ſeauen yeare in augmenting and encreaſing his Citie and people, and at laſt came to the ende of his yeares: And there reigned after him <hi>Troos</hi> his ſonne. This <hi>Troos</hi> was the third king of <hi>Dardane,</hi> and was a ſtrong man fierce, and hardy in armes, and increaſed greatly his ſeignoury and his Crowne, inſomuch as the <hi>Dardanians</hi>
                        <pb n="25" facs="tcp:7118:20"/>
ſaid, that there was no king but <hi>Troyes:</hi> and named them <hi>Troians.</hi> And thus was <hi>Troy</hi> enhaunced more then all the Realmes of <hi>Greece,</hi> ſo highly that the king <hi>Tantalus</hi> of <hi>Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie</hi> had great enuie, and gaue his heart and courage how he might anull and put downe the name of <hi>Troy</hi> that was his neighbour. And began to aſſay to bring it downe, as heereafter ſhall be ſaid.</p>

wiſe men of <hi>Epire,</hi> ſaw this warre ſo diſſolute, and that they of their partie had iniuſtly and vnrightfully vndertaken and begunne this warre, they knowledged their fault, and went to the king <hi>Lycaon,</hi> bearing branches of Oliue, in ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of peace and loue, and him required that he would condiſcend to accord and peace of both peoples. <hi>Lycaon</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that his people had as much loſt as woonne by this diſcention, and that the battailes were perillous, accorded to the <hi>Epitiens</hi> the peace, by condition that they ſhould deliuer him one of their moſt noble men, ſuch as he would demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, for to be his ſeruant a ſpace of time, in token that they had vnrightfully engendred this diſcention. The <hi>Epiriens</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to this condition, and deliuered to king <hi>Lycaon</hi> in ſeruitude the moſt noble man among them: and thus ended the warre.</p>

                     <p>All they that then were preſent, as well his ſeruants as ſtraungers, as well <hi>Epiriens</hi> as <hi>Pelagiens,</hi> had anon great horrour, when they heard and vnderſtoode the wordes of king <hi>Lycaon:</hi> they had great ſhame and furor to beholde ſo ſhamefull and abhominable a worke, and outrageous ſinne: and were ſo troubled, that the blood went fro their faces, and they laid their hands afore their eies, as they that abhorred to beholde the poore martyr <hi>Epirien.</hi> And there was no man wiſt what to ſay of the infamie of king <hi>Lycaon,</hi> vnneth. When the king ſaw them ſo troubled, and that euery man began to frowne and grudge apart, he left them, and went from thence into his chamber: and then euery man roſe from the Table, abhorring and eſchewing the ſent and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of the dead man, and would haue departed and gone their way all confuſe, had not <hi>Iupiter</hi> the ſon of <hi>Saturne</hi> béene, which the <hi>Epiriens</hi> had brought with them in their legation and Ambaſſage, foraſmuch as hée was a fayre childe, amiable and gentle. He then when hée ſawe that euerie man drewe a part his way, put himſelfe in the middeſt of the <hi>Epiriens,</hi> and began beganne his glorious enterpriſes, and ſaid to them in this wiſe: O what is this? Where is the blood of the <hi>Epiriens?</hi> Are they baniſhed out of hardineſſe? bée they exiled out of valour, and of honeſtie? Which be the <hi>Epiriens</hi> that by force will expoſe themſelues to the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geaunce of ſo foule and horrible a déede? This caſe is not to bee borne.

                        <hi>Iupiter</hi> anſwered and ſayde: worſhipfull Lordes and ſirs, I am not wiſe inough to receyue the honour that yée do me: nor my tender yeares ſhall not accept it.

Then ye ſhall ſhew this poore dead man: for it is ſayde that the King is not well beloued with his owne people for his vnmanlie workes, and this miſdéed and treſpaſſe is paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing foule and pitious: anon as they ſhall knowe what hee
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:7118:22"/>
hath done, by this foule worke: ye ſhall well ſée if they will take in this ſinne, pleaſure or diſpleaſure. If pleaſure, then it were in vaine and follie for to ſpeake thereof, for this preſent time any more, but wée muſt ſéeke remedie, in our returne to <hi>Epire.</hi> If they take diſpleaſure, ye may plainly diſcouer your courages, and prouoke and call them to purge this crime that is ſo curſed: and I wéen that they ſhall right lightly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to vs: And, for none amytie that is betwéene him and them, he ſhall not dominere nor reigne ouer them by ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rany: For, he is not their naturall Lord: but, he is the ſonne of <hi>Titan,</hi> brother of <hi>Saturne:</hi> And, is not King by election: but by force.</p>
                     <p>All they that heard <hi>Iupiter</hi> thus ſpeake, meruailed greatly of him, and accorded them to his councell, in ſuch wiſe that no man contraryed it nor agayn ſayde it. And ſo ſodainly they tooke the murdred <hi>Epirien,</hi> and bare him to the common place, and there they ſhewed him openly in euery mans ſight. When the <hi>Pelagiens</hi> ſaw this dead man, of whome the ſkin was ſcorched, the fleſh roſted, the knowes ſhronken, and that the bones appeared by the ioyntures: they aſſembled all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him in great number, and caſting their eyes vpon him, they had ſo great horror, abhominacion and abaſhment, that their heartes trembled, playning eche to other: and many went away for compaſſion, wept, and araged trembling for anger. And, other tooke duſte and powder and caſted into the ayre in ſigne of ſorrow, cutting their clothes, and ſaying, lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their hands on high. O goddes almightie, what people bée theſe <hi>Epiriens?</hi> Haue they roſted a mannes body, and haue brought it to fore vs? What meane they? are we eaters of mannes fleſh? or bring they it to vs to ſhewe the cruelty of their courage? or come they for to eate this dead man among vs, for to feare vs withall?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Iupiter</hi> there being awayting, and laying his eares, and ſeing with his eyes the maner of the <hi>Pellagiens,</hi> and their countenaunces, concerning that they condeſcended in the condemnacion and enimitie of him that wrought this pite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:7118:23"/>
worke: when he had heard their reaſons, and had ſéene their woondrings, he adreſſed himſelfe among them, and ſaid in this wiſe: O ye men of <hi>Pelage,</hi> meruaile you of this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly and vnnaturall worke? Haue ye not enough lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and knowen the tyrannies of your king <hi>Lycaon?</hi> he hath murthred this man, and this man is the <hi>Epirien</hi> that was deliuered to him at the treatie of the peace of you and of vs, for to ſerue him.

behelde without ceaſing this damoſel, and could not enough complayne her beautie: for as much as ſhe would into re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, with great paine, when he had heard her anſwers, and had ſéene how ſwéetely ſhe had taken it, and woulde not be turned from her will: he ſaid to her, that her requeſt ſhoulde bée accompliſhed. Then he called the <hi>Epiriens,</hi> and required them that they would be content to ſuffer this virgin to enter into religion. What ſhall I ſay? The <hi>Epiriens</hi> put the requeſt in the will of <hi>Iupiter:</hi> and <hi>Iupiter</hi> did ſo much, that ſhée was conducted, and led into the religion of virgins. After, he ſearched all the Pallace of King <hi>Lycaon,</hi> and made the <hi>Epiriens</hi> to ſeiſe his richeſſe. And there <hi>Iupiter</hi> abode a certayne time, with ſo great worſhip, that the <hi>Pelagiens</hi> and the <hi>Epiriens</hi> would haue crowned him to be their king: But he would neuer conſent thereto: as he that conſidered ouer his young age, and the variati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of fortune, and ſayd, that it auayleth more to a man, and is to him more ſure, to be made king in his old age, then in his youth, for the diuers perils that may fall. Alway he accorded that he would be Captayne of the realme, and was a man of great iuſtice, ſwéete and curteous vnto al ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of people, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>This was the firſt comming vp of this noble Childe. When he had brought in ſubiection to his pleaſance the <hi>Pelagiens,</hi> he buried the <hi>Epirien</hi> that <hi>Lycaon</hi> had murthered, as it is ſayde before, and did his obſequye ſolemnlye, and after he did burne into aſhes the <hi>Pelagiens,</hi> that had béene ſlaine in the helpe of <hi>Lycaon.</hi> And after that he ſent word, and did all theſe things to be knowne and ſhewed to the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riens</hi> that were left at home in <hi>Epire,</hi> as to the King <hi>Meliſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us:</hi> whereof all the <hi>Epiriens,</hi> and the king <hi>Melliſeus</hi> gaue thankes vnto their goddes. But for as much as I muſte tell all: after this he gaue not his heart and courage ſo much to accompliſhe theſe thinges, but that otherwhile hée gaue himſelfe to remember and to thinke on the beautie that hée had ſéene in the religious <hi>Caliſto,</hi> whereby the ſparkles

of loue enuironed ſtrongly his heart, in ſuch wiſe that day and night, hée wiſhed her in his armes, and repented him that he had conſented that ſhe went into religion. And ſo laboured in this maner, that his reſt in the night was taken from him, and he was not nowe his owne man, ſo encreaſed he to loue and deſire this virgin: and for to ſée her, he made hir paſtime to haunt the wooddes, and continually to hunt the wilde beaſtes in the Forreſt with Dame <hi>Diana,</hi> where, by Fortune and aduenture otherwhile hée recountred and mette the maide <hi>Caliſto.</hi> And when hée had once ſéene her, that day hee was all ioyous. And if he ſawe her not, hee had aboundaunce of many thoughts, that ranne readily in his minde. I may not all day tarrie on this matter. Hee thought ſtill howe he might come to the grace of this reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious <hi>Caliſto,</hi> and all thoughts reduced and brought into one, he concluded on a day in himſelfe, that hee would put him in the habite of a religious woman, and would go into the Cloiſter of dame <hi>Diana,</hi> faigning to be a woman, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring to be receiued with the virgins.</p>
                     <p>This concluſion taken and ratified in <hi>Iupiter,</hi> by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny deliberations in diuerſe dayes, hée did make his wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans cloathing by a ſec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them that hee ſo would: and then hee withdrewe him into his Chamber, and tooke the keyes of the great gate, and on the morrow betimes, when he was arayed and dreſſed in the veſture and cloating of a mayd, he departed from thence alone, and entred into the woodde, and ſo behaued himſelfe that hée came to the habitation of the religious maydens.

                        <hi>Iupiter</hi> had yet no beard, and was white and fayre coloured in the viſage. When he came vnto the religion, he knocked at the gate, and then came to him a paſſing fayre mayde na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Athalanta,</hi> that after was wife vnto the king <hi>Melea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> of <hi>Achay.</hi> And ſhée demaunded him, what hee would. <hi>Iupiter</hi> aunſwered: noble virgin, Alas I am a poore woman of a noble houſe: I haue auowed to the gods my virginitie: I pray you that you will preſent mee vnto the Ladie of this place, to the ende that I might ſerue the gods, and be of the number of the other virgins. And, if it pleaſe the goddes, I ſhall deſerue it at your hands. <hi>Athalanta</hi> moued with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion to the maide, accorded him his requeſt, and preſented him to Dame <hi>Diana. Iupiter</hi> ſpake all ſo ſwéetely and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murely, and made ſo humble and feminine manners, that he ſéemed properly to be a maide. <hi>Diana</hi> be helde him well and long, and ſaid, that ſhe had neuer ſéene ſo faire a maide, nor ſo great: and then welcommed him, and receyued him. Then <hi>Iupiter</hi> thanked Dame <hi>Diana</hi> of her grace, and <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanta</hi> of her courteſie, and had good hope in his enterpriſe, when he ſawe himſelfe ſo ſoone receyued without knowing. Then <hi>Iupiter</hi> began to learne to ſpinne, and to worke in ſilke, and to do the exerciſes of maydens. And it became him as well as he had béene a mayd. He was humble, and of ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie conuerſation: he laboured with his handes, with his eyes, and his heart: with his handes hee made corporall workes, with his eyes hee behelde oft tymes ſecretly the beautie of <hi>Caliſto,</hi> and with his heart, imagining and plotting howe and by what meane hee might beguile and deceyue <hi>Caliſto,</hi> hee oft tymes conuerſed, and fellowſhipt with her.</p>
                     <p>His heart was alway in right great paine: otherwhile he was moued with great heauines, and otherwhile in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort &amp; hope to ſpéed well: and wiſt not what to ſay nor do, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as ſhame and dread were more in him than hardines. What ſhal I ſay more he was lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gin this pain, more doubtful &amp; ſhamefaſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hardy.

and finding on a day <hi>Caliſto</hi> beſide a well where ſhe refre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed her, as ſhe that was weary that had runne long with dame <hi>Diana,</hi> chaſing then and hunting a wilde beaſt: hee ſate him downe by her and ſaide: My ſiſter <hi>Caliſto,</hi> I yéeld me to thee, and to thy grace. I am a man, and no woman: thy beautie hath ouercome my courage. For to come to the point where we he now, I haue clothed me like a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and a maid. Alas I require thée, that thou receiue me vnto thy loue, ſo ſhall we liue togither in the religion, and we ſhall take our ſports and pleaſures. A man hath nothing in this worlde but his life.

                     <p>When <hi>Caliſto</hi> had heard <hi>Iupiter</hi> and knew that he was a man, ſhe was afraide, and roſe vp, wéening to haue fled, but ſhe might not, for <hi>Iupiter</hi> held her faſt by the clothing, and made her to ſit downe by him, clipping her about the necke, and kiſſed her by force, ſo much that <hi>Caliſto</hi> cried out and ſaid. O <hi>Iupiter,</hi> what folly is this? wéeneſt thou that I am ſo to bee ouercome of thy flattering wordes? I had much leuer the earth woulde open, and ſwallow mee vppe into his wombe.

with theſe words <hi>Caliſto</hi> began to crie with al her might: and <hi>Iupiter</hi> began to accompliſh his pleaſure of her.

                     <p>IN this time that the young <hi>Archas</hi> was crowned king of <hi>Pelage,</hi> and that he named the Cytie <hi>Archadia</hi> after his name, the king <hi>Saturne</hi> was ſo great, and ſo puiſſaunt, that for to ample and increaſe the ſplendor of his natiuity, he named himſelfe <hi>Saturne</hi> ſonne of heauen, and of earth. But then as he began to ſtudy how and by what maner hée might exalt the ſplendour of his felicitie by diuine miſteries, fortune turned her backe to him warde. And as there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in earth that may abide and endure: ſo it happend that <hi>Tytan</hi> was all acertained, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> quene <hi>Cibell</hi> had diuerſe men children that ſhe did cauſe to be kepte ſecretly, and ſo had ſaued their liues. <hi>Boccace</hi> that recounteth this hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, in the fourth booke of the genealogie of the goddes, ſayth not by what meane. <hi>Titan</hi> knewe this thing alwaye, eyther by ſuſpection or by enuy that he had of the glorye of <hi>Saturne</hi> his Brother, or by ſecret aduertiſement, Vnder this colour, he determined in his courage, that he woulde aſſayle <hi>Saturne</hi> by armes, and for this cauſe he did aſſemble on a daye al his ſonnes, and them required, that they would ayde and helpe him to get the land of <hi>Crete,</hi> ſaying that hée woulde make warre againſt <hi>Saturne</hi> his Brother: and that by right and iuſte tytle he had good cauſe, for he had not put to death dyuerſe men children that his wife <hi>Cibell</hi> had conceyued of his ſéede, like as he had promiſed and ſworne.</p>

                     <p>The olde <hi>Titan</hi> had in his heart great ioy, when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>helde the frée and great courages of his ſonnes.

They went and made ſuch diligence, and ſo exployted, that there were aſſembled great armour and harneſſe, and much people at the ſayd port.

                     <p>When <hi>Saturne</hi> had read this letter, as a man all ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, ſent for his wife <hi>Cibell,</hi> and tooke her apart, and adiured and charged her to ſay the truth, and tell him what ſhee had done with his children.

Had not I béene in nature an abhominable monſter, if I ſhould haue deuoured with my hande the children of my wombe? where is that mother that will murther her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren? Certes, my hand was neuer man-ſlear, nor neuer ſhall be. I haue erred againſt thy commaundement, in the fauour of nature: and ſince it muſt néedes be ſo, I had leuer to bee murthered then a murtherer: and to be named pitious, then cruell, for murther is crueltie appertaining to vnreaſonable beaſtes, and to tyrants: and pitie is naturally appertaining to a woman. And therefore I confeſſe to haue borne thrée ſonnes, conceyued of thy ſéede, which I haue cauſed to bee nouriſhed ſecretly: but demaund me no further, for where they bée, they ſhall liue, as long as it pleaſeth fortune, will <hi>Titan</hi> or not: and there is no death whereof any woman may bée tormented with, that ſhall make the places to bée diſcouered where they be.</p>

Realme: my wife hath confeſſed, that ſhee hath receiued of mee three Sonnes, which ſhee hath nouriſhed in a ſtraunge lande, vnder the colour that I ſhoulde not flea them. <hi>Titan</hi> aſſayleth mee. What ſhall wee do? Syr, aunſwered the wiſe men, where force is enhaunced by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer great preſumption, there muſt bee policie to conduct wiſelie, and to put the hande to withſtande it. Thou haſt a ſtrong Citie, and fulfilled with great people: thou art wiſe for to gouerne them: put thy ſelfe in armes, and take no regarde to the quarell of <hi>Titan.</hi> A man is not woorthie to bee a King, but if it be in his vertue and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle manners. <hi>Crete</hi> was neuer Realme but nowe. <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> hath béene all his lyfe inclined to vyces, and is all wrapped in ſinne, in which purpoſe hee ſéeketh to come to thy Crowne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If hee extoll himſelfe, thou muſt debaſe and put him downe. This is the remedie, helpe thy ſelfe, and we ſhall helpe thee. He that flyeth, cauſeth his enemies, to chaſe him. Thus nowe it may not be eſchewed, but wee muſt withſtande and aſſault our enemie, and that couragiouſlie. For what a man may do this day, let him not put it ouer till to morrow.</p>
                     <p>Arme thée then well and ſurely, and aſſayle from thy Citie thine enemies. If thou ſo do, thou ſheweſt thy courage to bée aduaunced greatly,, and not lightly to bée o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome by any: and ſo thou mayeſt abate ſomewhat their pride and preſumption. If thou behaue otherwiſe thy ſelfe, and let them take their reſt, that ſhall bee matter and cauſe for to encourage them: vpon which they will waxe proud, hoping to come to their purpoſe, which ſhall bee to thée more harming then auaylable: For courage and hope oft tymes (men ſay) make men to attaine to become con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours great and hie. Notwithſtanding, thou art king: thy will be accompliſhed and fulfilled.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Saturne</hi> aunſwered and ſayd. Brethren and friends, it were great ſhame to vs and our Citie, if we ſuffered it to bée diſſipate and deſtroyed. It is of force that the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:7118:31"/>
warre be begunne and open, and euerie man diſpoſe him to ſaue his worſhip. <hi>Titan</hi> aſſayleth mine honour, and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth my diſhonour. Since it muſt bée that of this matter the armes and warre bée iudges, wee ſhall arme vs this houre, and purſue the intertainment of the right good aduenture of Fortune that ſhall come to vs. And my heart telleth mee, that as ſodainlie as our enemies bee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into this lande, as ſodainlie wee ſhall make them to go and iſſue out agayne. With this anſwere all the wiſe and noble men of <hi>Crete</hi> tooke great pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>Then <hi>Saturne</hi> gaue the aunſwere to the Meſſenger of <hi>Titan,</hi> and ſayde vnto him: if <hi>Titan,</hi> returned not within two houres, that hee would come and take the battell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt him. With this aunſwere the Meſſenger returned to <hi>Titan,</hi> and tolde him the intention of <hi>Saturne. Titan</hi> ſwore then that hee woulde neuer turne backewarde, till hee had attended and abiden the battaile. <hi>Saturne</hi> was a man of great valour, and hie will. When the Meſſenger of <hi>Titan</hi> was departed, hee made ſownd to Armes, at which ſownd the young and olde armed them, and made them readie. What ſhall I make long proceſſe? in ſhort tyme they were readie at the poynt: and when <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne</hi> ſawe that his enemyes made no ſemblance to mooue, hee went and aſcended into his Chayre (for in this tyme the Kings went to battaile in Chayres.) After hée iſſued out of his Cittie, and raunged his people about him, and anon after hee cauſed them to march agaynſt his brother <hi>Titan,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>As ſoone as the <hi>Titanoys</hi> ſaw the <hi>Saturniens</hi> come, they were right glad, and made themſelues the greateſt chéere of the world, and moued themſelues ioyouſly againſt them: and with a great crie, they had great ſhéelds of trée, maces &amp; pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lares, and guiſarmes of ſtrange faſhions, and they were all on foote except <hi>Titan,</hi> and his ſons, which as kings had their Curres and Chayres, in which they were brought and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed, not by the force of horſe, but by the puiſſaunce of men.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:7118:32"/>
They approched ſo nigh, that they came to fighting, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to fall to worke: then the archers of king <hi>Saturne</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to draw and ſhoote, and made the <hi>Tytanoys</hi> to ſtay and ſtand as long as their ſhot dured, and ſlew and hurt many of them. When the ſhot failed, the <hi>Tytanoys,</hi> that had great ſorrow for to be ſo ſerued of the <hi>Saturnyens,</hi> ordered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues again, and ſwore the one to the other, that they wold be auenged, and came forth and fought hand to hand: in which they beſtirred them ſo eagerly, that for the noyſe and dinne that their axes and guiſarmes ſmote vppon their ſhieldes, it ſéemed as it had béene thunder. At the encounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring then the battaile was right fell: <hi>Lichaon, Egeon, Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Tiphon,</hi> &amp; <hi>Encheladus,</hi> were in the firſt front: there was many a ſhield broken, with the weight of clubs and polaxes, and many heades broken. <hi>Ceon</hi> and <hi>Tiphon,</hi> at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning maintained themſelues right valiantly, and conducted their folke all within the battaile by the rigour of their ſtrokes, inſomuch that whom they met of the <hi>Saturniens,</hi> they beate them downe. By their well doing they were knowen and doubted of their enemies, inſomuch that <hi>Saturn</hi> made his chaire to be led out of the way, for the great bruit and noyſe that they made about him. There was great effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of bloud, for the <hi>Tytanoys</hi> did what they could to haue endured in their bruit and crie: and the <hi>Saturniens</hi> with <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne</hi> laboured for to abate it and breake it. And ſo the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of <hi>Saturne</hi> was cauſe of proweſſe vpon proweſſe, and and of many one dead, and they intended one and other ſo buſily to their worke, that the moſt part of the day they fought ſo, that none might glorie for victorie, nor be troubled for diſcomfiture. But in the end when the <hi>Tytanoys</hi> ſawe the ſunne decline, as couetous of glorie and of worſhippe, at one crie that <hi>Titan</hi> made, vpon <hi>Saturne, Lichaon</hi> and <hi>Egeon,</hi> with many other encloſed about him (he being from his company, his chaire broken by force of polaxes) and gaue him many wounds: and finally they tooke him, and brought many of the <hi>Saturnyens</hi> to death, and ouerthrew them in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfiture.
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:7118:32"/>
And that worſe is, they were ſo diſcouraged, when they vnderſtoode that <hi>Saturne</hi> was taken, that they loſt the vigors and ſtrength of their hearts, and the might of their armes, &amp; turned their backs and fled all ſo out of order, that the <hi>Titanoys</hi> entred with them into the Citie, and tooke it, and wanne it without any reſiſtance, beating downe the people, with great murther of men, women, and of ſmall children.</p>
                     <p>At this time men might ſée the Ladies and Matrones of <hi>Crete,</hi> take the duſt, and caſt it into the ayre, and runne by the ſtréetes, nowe here, and now there, all without ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes, with theyr haire hanging about their heades, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting away their attyre, and their little Children crying after them. The wiſe men of the Towne, ſéemed out of their wittes, and the Citie was ſo troubled, that they might not be more. Among all other, <hi>Cibell, Veſca,</hi> and <hi>Ceres,</hi> made great ſorrow likewiſe, without ceaſing: for <hi>Titan,</hi> that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer loued them, came then into the pallace, and put in priſon <hi>Saturne</hi> and his wife, and ſwore they ſhould neuer depart thence, till they had put to death all their ſonnes that were come of them.

And ſo for to eſchue the furors of thy father, thou haſt béene here nouriſhed all thy dayes, and knoweſt not thy ſelfe what thou wert, and nowe thou art certaine. What ioy is this to thée? certainly great. And thou oughteſt to go ioyouſly vnto thy father and mother, preſenting thy ſelfe vnto their grace: if it were not that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter theſe tydings of ioy, I muſt néedes ſhewe vnto thée <hi>(Iupiter)</hi> other tydings: and that is this.

When <hi>Eſculapius</hi> ſawe this, hee greatly meruailed, and tarried, and he had not long abiden, but that the heardman had ouercome the baſiliſque, and conſtrained him to withdraw him vpon a Rocke that was there nigh by. <hi>Eſculapius</hi> was all amazed with this thing, ſo that he wiſt not what to ſay: for he thought it was impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for a man to ouercome one ſo mortall a beaſt. Then when that the baſiliſque was withdrawne vpon the rocke, <hi>Eſculapius</hi> went haſtily vnto the heardman, and finding that he had on his head a chapellet or garland made of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diuerſe hearbs and flowers, he iudged incontinently that in this foreſaide garland was an hearbe of ſuch vertue that kept him from the death, and alſo from the ſubtile venime of the baſiliſque. Then he intreated ſo, that the heardman or ſhepheard, gaue him his chapellet or garland, as ignorant of the vertue thereof: and then the ſaide heardman went againe for to aſſaile the baſiliſque: and ſodainely with one proper ſight of his eyes, the poore ſhepheard fell dead vnto the earth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Eſculapius</hi> was then well aſſured, that hee had well thought that in the chapellet was an hearbe that ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſed to withſtand againſt the malicious interication of the venemous eyes of beaſts: and with the ſaide chapellet, he went to the Rocke, and fought ſo againſt the baſiliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que that hee ſlew him. Whereof hee had ſo great ſay, that a heart aſpiring to worſhip might haue no more. When he had thus doone, he went vnto the heardman, and hauing

pitie on him, tooke all the heaths one after another, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the chapellet was made: and put them ſeuerally each by himſelfe in his mouth.

O maruailous vertue of an hearbe men reade that by the ſame hearbe, <hi>Hippolitus</hi> (which came vnto his death by the meanes of his ſtepmother, who accuſed him falſely) afterward was raiſed to life againe, and after hee had beene long dead, and drawne through buſhes, hedges, mountaines &amp; thornes, when his bodie was found, and they that found him laide him in a meddow vpon a plat of hearbs like vnto the hearbe wherof is ſpoken before, by vertue of the ſame his wounds were healed, and his life was giuen and yeelded vnto him againe.</p>
                     <p>For to holde on the matter: when <hi>Eſculapius</hi> had raiſed the heardman or ſheapheard, hee tooke the hearbe and the baſiliſque, and bare them vnto the Citie of <hi>Paphos,</hi> telling his aduenture, and from thenceforth he raiſed men from death to life, by vertue of the hearbe, and fought and ouercame baſiliſques.

                     <p>In thoſe daies, when <hi>Saturne</hi> ſaw him quit of <hi>Titan,</hi> and of his generations, and that he ſaw his children mount from lowe places into reignes of high Chaires, all his ſorrowes vaniſhed away, and then beganne the cleareneſſe of his reigne to bee peaceable: all doubtes, all dreades, all ſuſpitions were put away: Hée had of the goods of Fortune as much as hee woulde: None was then ſo hardie that durſt conſpire againſt his dominion: hée founde himſelfe in peace generall.

When they of <hi>Crete</hi> heard this, they were ſore troubled: for they ſought him that they would not finde. Notwithſtanding they went in, and paſſed foorth vp to the Pallace, and there finding <hi>Iupiter</hi> with the nobles of <hi>Arcadia,</hi> after the reuerence made, one of them ſpake, and ſayde: Syr, we ſéeke thée: and we haue no will to finde thée, for, wée come againſt our will, to execute a commiſſion, by the which maye ſooner come ruine &amp; trouble then peace to <hi>Crete</hi> and vs. <hi>Saturne</hi> thy father commaundeth thée that thou alone come ſpeake with him. he hath ſought thée in all the places of <hi>Partheny.</hi> His daughter <hi>Iuno</hi> thy wife (not thinking e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill) hath aſcertayned him that thou art come hither.

His Realme is in peace. I haue put and ſet him againe in his Realme, he putteth himſelfe in armes without my knowledge, and nowe he ſendeth for me, that I ſhoulde alone come ſpeake with him: that is too ſtraunge a thing vnto mee. And, hée behaueth himſelfe not as hee ought to do: for men ought to prayſe them that haue deſerued it, and be of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue. I haue auayled him as much as his Realme is woorth: and hee hath other tymes ſent for mee to make warre. I wote not nowe what euill will he hath, or may haue to mee.

All things conſidered and weighed: I haue no reaſon for to obey his commaundement: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that hee is my Father: foraſmuch as the ſuſpition is too much apparaunt. But I am content, if hee haue to do with mee, to ſerue him, and to come to him, vppon condition that I ſhall bee accompanyed with all my friends that I can get, and none otherwiſe.</p>
                     <p>The two Commiſſaryes, with this worde returned vnto <hi>Saturne,</hi> and tolde him the intention of <hi>Iupiter. Saturne</hi> tooke right impaciently the aunſwere of <hi>Iupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and approached vnto <hi>Archadie,</hi> and beſieged it, with great oathes making his auowe vnto his goddes, that if hee may haue <hi>Iupiter,</hi> hee with his handes would make ſacrifice of him. And then hee ſent for his moſte wiſe men, and willed them, that in fell menaces they ſhould go ſummon the King <hi>Archas,</hi> and the <hi>Archadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens,</hi> to yéelde and deliuer him <hi>Iupiter:</hi> declaring o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penlie

                     <p>The wiſe men departed from the Hoſte, at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of <hi>Saturne,</hi> and did well theyr deuoier to ſummon the <hi>Archadians:</hi> and ſayde to the King and people of <hi>Archadie:</hi> we bee come vnto you, foraſmuch as yee ſuſtayne <hi>Iupiter,</hi> whome the King <hi>Saturne</hi> holdeth for his enemy, telling you if ye deliuer him vnto <hi>Saturne,</hi> ye ſhall bee his friendes: and if not, hee doeth you to wit, that ye doe kéepe you with good watch and warde, for hee hath not in the worlde whom hee reputeth greater enemies than you, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>By this commaundement knewe <hi>Iupiter,</hi> that it was hée himſelfe for whom <hi>Saturne</hi> made his armie. The <hi>Archadiens</hi> aſſembled to councell without <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and ſpake of this matter, and made aunſwere to the wiſe men of <hi>Crete,</hi> howe they were bounden to ſerue <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and howe they woulde kéepe him, and liue and die with him, agaynſt all men, aboue all other. When the wiſe men had their aunſwere, they returned vnto <hi>Saturne,</hi> and tolde him the aunſwere of the <hi>Archadiens.</hi> Anon ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilie ſore chafed, and enflaming with great yre, hee commaunded, that the Citie ſhoulde bée aſſayled. Anon went to Armes they of <hi>Crete,</hi> in ſuch wiſe, that they approched the walles and fortes. And when the <hi>Archadiens</hi> ſawe their enemies approch, anon they ſounded to armes, and came to the fight, and plyed them to defend theyr walles with great courage. Then was drawne and ſhot many an arrow, and many a ſtone caſt, and manie bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and hurt, as well within as without: Gunnes, Bombards, he great artillarie was none in this time in the Realmes.

                     <p>And for to doo thus, <hi>Iupiter</hi> had induced and taught the <hi>Archadien</hi> people men, and women, that when

But this notwithſtanding he thought right well on his hurte people, and went to their Tentes, and did cauſe to miniſter medicines vnto them that were hurte. &amp;c.</p>

Peace noriſheth profit: by peace are proſpered menne and children: townes and Cities are vnited and knit togither by charytye, and made as one by amorous communication. By peace, Realmes profite, in beautifying and building fayre houſes: in labouring and earing the earth and in length of

life. By peace, mens bodyes be whole and quyet: and it is that thing that cauſeth a man to demaund ſoueraygntie. O <hi>Saturne,</hi> it ſéemeth that thou reckeſt not of this good vertue, for reygning in peace and tranquillitie there is no king nor Prince that dare ſhewe him againſt thée. Thou haſt not onely troubled thy Realme: but thou art abuſer of warre, For to haue peace, a man ought to order and diſpoſe to the warre. Thou doeſt all otherwiſe: and regardeſt not, that thy ſon <hi>Iupiter</hi> hath deliuered thée from the bondes of thine other enimies, and hath ſette thy Diademe in a ſuerty of peace, which thou might not do without him? ſeeſt thou not, that by making him warre, thou canſt not haue peace: and, that thou deſtroyeſt and breakeſt this peace; ſeeſt thou not that this is thy ſonne by warring againſt whome thou art a Monſter in nature? The fathers naturally do loue their children: and the rude and brute beaſtes kéepe and holde this condition of nature. Thou ſéekeſt and wouldeſt deſtroy the bloud of thy ſonne. And from whence commeth this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall appetyte?

Sée I not howe hée inhaunceth himſelfe the moſt hee can? Sée I not howe the people by his fayre and fawning woordes owe him more fauour then me? Sée I not that he flyeth from mee?

I wote not howe the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadiens</hi> take it: but if I may once ſet my hande on them, there was neuer ſo great a deſtruction as ſhall come vnto <hi>Archadie.</hi> And I haue not as nowe anie purpoſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from this place, till I haue vtterly razed this Citie that is rebell agaynſt mee, and my commaundements.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Iupiter</hi> had great diſpleaſure in himſelfe, for that hee ſawe that his father was ſo grieued, and would not bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: yet notwithſtanding, hee doubted not ſo much, but that he tooke courage to him, and ſayde, hee was more hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to kéepe his life, then to obey the euill will of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that hated him at his birth. This night paſſed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, anon after that the ſun cleared &amp; lighted the ayre, about the thirde houre of the day, <hi>Archas, Iupiter,</hi> and the men of warre of the Citie, went into the field in good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: and they were not ſo ſoone iſſued out of the gates,

                     <p>And thus began the dolorous battaile of <hi>Saturne</hi> and <hi>Iupiter.</hi> There was the father agaynſt the ſonne, and the ſonne agaynſt the father.

I am thy ſonne, and thy ſeruaunt. Thou haſt no cauſe to perſecute mée.

They doubted <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and had no power to withſtande and fight, ſo well as they woulde haue done, if they had felt the quarrell good: and by this maner was the batteldemeaned, to the great preiudice of the <hi>Saturniens. Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi> ſubmitted himſelfe to his father, and often times cried in his eare, that hee ſhould withdraw him, or the battaile would be worſe, or be loſt. Hee withſtoode his ſtroakes a great while, waiting that hee would conforme and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert himſelfe from his euill opinion. But then at laſt, when <hi>Iupiter</hi> tooke héede, and ſawe that he would in no wiſe heare him, he opened and diſplayed his valour, and the great might of his armes and of his ſword, and made ſuch affray vpon his aduerſaries, breaking their helmes, and hewing their harneſſe, not in manner of a man hauing all day ſuſtained the feare of great ſtroakes and conflicts of the <hi>Saturniens:</hi> but in the manner of a Champion freſh and newe, of whome the ſtrokes redou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled.</p>
                     <p>Thus then it ſéemed vnto the <hi>Saturniens,</hi> that in multiplying of the horions and ſtroakes, the ſtrength and puiſſance of <hi>Iupiter</hi> beganne to reuiue and grow.

But in concluſion, whan his men ſawe that the warre went with them alway from euill into worſe, they beganne to retire, and turned the backe and fled: and then <hi>Saturne</hi> turned and fled in likewiſe.

the king <hi>Acriſyus,</hi> whereof is made mention in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this chapter. Theſe were the parents and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitours of king <hi>Acryſius:</hi> he was right puiſſant in riches, but he named himſelfe poore, for he had no children but one daughter onely, which he named <hi>Danaes:</hi> and for to haue a ſonne, hee went day by day into the temples and oracles of the gods: and there made prayers and ſacrifices inough, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtings, almeſſes, and other ſuffrages. All theſe things might not helpe to bring to paſſe the accompliſhment of his deſire. His wife came vnto her barraine yeares, and hee was out of all hope to haue any childe male, and then he comforted him in <hi>Danaes</hi> his daughter, and ſet his loue ſo greatly on her, that he had no pleaſance but onely to be hold her: and hee purpoſed that neuer man ſhoulde haue her, but if it were the moſt noble and valliant man of the world. But for as much as in this world is nothing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durable, this loue was of little enduring, and that by the procuring of the king <hi>Acryſius,</hi> for that the loue hee had in <hi>Danaes</hi> grew in ampliation of naturall ielouſie, hee went into the oracle of God <hi>Belus</hi> his olde Grand-father, and, ſearching what ſhould be the deſtinie of his daughter, he did cauſe him to be anſwered, that of her ſhould come a ſonne that ſhould turne him into a ſtone.</p>
                     <p>By this anſwere, <hi>Acryſius</hi> beganne to fall from the great loue that he had to his daughter: he returned ſorrrowfull and penſiue into his houſe; and became all melancolike, without taking ioy or pleaſure in any thing that he ſawe. His daughter was then yong: hee ſawe her often times, otherwhile in crueltie, and ſometime in pittie. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe of that that he looked to be tranſformed into a ſtone, by him that by deſtinie ſhould be borne of his daughter, moued him to cruelty, in ſuch wiſe that often times he determined that he would put her to death, and ſo to ſpoyle his bloud, to the ende for to remedie his infortune. But when hée had taken in his hand the ſword wherewith he wéened to flea her, nature beganne to meddle and put in her ſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:7118:48"/>
them and from this crueltie made him to condiſcend to pitie, and put awaye his ſword, and let the ſheading of her blood, that was come of his owne bloud, the which ſhoulde come vnto the ſucceſſion of his crowne which his auncient progenitours had ordayned before, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>For to ſaye the veritie: this king <hi>Acriſius</hi> from thence foorth tooke his reſt croſſed with many ſighes, and could not be aſſured of himſelfe. His daughter grewe, and became a woman: ſhée was paſſing fayre, and right comely. Many kings and great earthly Lordes deſired to haue her in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and would haue endowed her with noble Crownes. But the king <hi>Acriſius</hi> refuſed all them that required her, and imagined, that his daughter, for her great beautie, might be taken awaye and rauiſhed, by which ſhe might by aduenture haue a ſonne that ſhould turne him vnto a ſtone. And to the ende to eſchewe this perill and daunger, he thought, that hée would make a Tower the ſtrongeſt in the world, and that in the ſame Tower ſhoulde his daughter <hi>Danaes</hi> be cloſed and ſhut, during her life, without coming of any man to her: for he was ſo ielous of her, that he beléeued her not well when he ſawe her.

                     <p>When hée hadde brought thither all his workemen, hée ſayd to them, that hée woulde haue a Tower made all of copper, with a gate ſeuerall from the Tower, to put in foure and twentie men of armes, for to kéepe the Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er if it were néede. The workemen bargayned with the king <hi>Acriſius,</hi> to make the Tower and the gate, and ſette on hand to the worke: the Tower was made in proceſſe of time: and then when all was achieued<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>Acriſius</hi> brought thither his daughter without letting her knowe his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion. And as ſoone as ſhe was in the Tower, he ſayd to her: My only daughter, it is come vnto my knowledge, that in
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:7118:49"/>
ſearching thy proſperitie, to my god <hi>Belus,</hi> I haue bin aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed, that of thée ſhall come a ſonne, which ſhall conuert and turne me into a ſtone. Thou knoweſt that euery man na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally coueteth and deſireth ſafely to liue in his life. I loue thée paſſing well, and nothing in the worlde ſo much excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting my life. But certaine my life toucheth mee more néere to my heart, then thy loue: wherefore I ſéeking and requiring the remedies agaynſt my predeſtinate infortune, would neuer giue thée in marriage to any man that hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quyred or deſired thée. Alſo, to the ende that generation diſcend not of thy bodie, and, that thou ſhouldeſt haue no knowledge of man during my life, I haue made to bée framed this tower of copper, and will that thou be cloſed and ſhut therein, and that no man ſée thée. I pray thée my daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, accord thée vnto my will and deſire: and take patience in this place for to paſſe thy time. I will prouide to accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie thée with manie noble virgins, that ſhall giue vnto thée all that thou canſt or mayſt thinke néedfull, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>When the noble damoſell <hi>Danae</hi> vnderſtoode the will of her father, ſhe behelde the Tower of Copper made for to kéepe her ſhut faſt there in. And further, when ſhe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that ſhe ſhould neuer marry during the life of her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the king, ſhe was ſore troubled about theſe things, and by great bitterneſſe with ſorrowfull heart began to wéepe, and ſaid: Alas my father, am I borne vnder ſo vnhappie a conſtellation, for to be a martyreſſe and priſoner, not in the end of my yeares, but in my young time? not in a priſon of ſtone, or of cement, but in a tower of Copper and Latton, in ſuch wiſe as I ſhould dwell therein, perpetually? Thou in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreteſt euill the ſentence of the God <hi>Belus,</hi> ſaying that of me ſhall be borne a ſonne that ſhall turne thée into a ſtone: For, by this ſentence ought none other thing to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode, but that I ſhall haue a ſonne that ſhall raigne af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thée, and ſhall turne thée into a ſtone. That is to ſay, that hee ſhall put thée into thy Sepulchre. Beholde, then what ſimpleneſſe ſhall it be to thée to beholde me thus
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:7118:49"/>
encloſed and ſhut in this Tower. My daughter (anſwered <hi>Acriſius</hi>) thou interpreteſt the Prognoſtication of our god <hi>Belus</hi> after that thée lyketh, to thy ioy and profite. It lyeth me ſore on my heart, that if thou haue a ſonne, he ſhall put me to death: and that is my iudgement and feare. Gainſay no more me, I am thy father, Lord, and maiſter ouer thée, thou ſhalt abide here, either by loue, or otherwiſe. At this concluſion when <hi>Danae</hi> ſaw that ſhe might not content her fearefull father, as wiſe and ſage as ſhe was, ſhe agréed and accorded to do his pleaſure, yéelding to it with the mouth, and not with the heart. And then the king ſent for virgins, and alſo olde matrones in all the Realme about; and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered his daughter vnto them for to accompanie, ſerue, and kéepe her, and made them all to be ſhut and cloſed in with her.

When he had thus done, he returned into the Citie of <hi>Argos,</hi> and aſſembled fortie ſtrong women, which he gaue wages, and pay to, and ſent them to kéepe the gate, and the entrie of the Tower. And then ſpread the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowme of theſe things, in ſo great a ſound and noyſe, that all <hi>Grece</hi> was full of the tydings, and there was no King ne Prince, but that complained the loſſe of the youth of faire <hi>Danae,</hi> then holden and named the moſt faire of al the <hi>Gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh</hi> maidens, daughter of the king, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>BY this Tower, and by this meane <hi>Acriſius</hi> thought to ouercome his predeſtinate miſfortune, and was well eaſed that his Daughter was in ſo ſure and ſafe a

place. All the world ſpake of her, and of her Tower: by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion they complained her ſtate, and it was ſo much ſpoken of this cauſe, that <hi>Iupiter</hi> had his eares full thereof: and not onely his eares, but alſo his heart: for in hearing the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation of the exceſſiue perfection of this virgine. <hi>Danae,</hi> he was amorous of her greatly and deſirouſly, aſſoone as the mariage of him and <hi>Iuno</hi> had bin conſummated. And then he began with all his heart, to thinke how and when, or in what maner he might come to ſée this Damoſell <hi>Danae.</hi> And ſo much he thought and ſtudied in this matter, that there was none other thing that hée woulde heare of, nor no conferences of his men, ſaue only of them that ſpake of the pryſon of <hi>Danae.</hi> And hée ſpake chéerefullye, and talked with all diligence, couetting inſtantly to be with her, and that as well in the preſence of <hi>Iuno,</hi> as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe: ſaying, many times, that he would that the Gods would giue him grace and power to bring this Damoſell <hi>Danae</hi> out of the Tower. &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>By this meane and theſe ſpéeches, <hi>Iuno</hi> was in doubte, and began to feele the firſt ſparkle of ielowſie, caſting infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite curſes and maledictions vpon <hi>Danae,</hi> and vpon all them that had ſowen thoſe tidings before her huſband. This ſhée ſhewed not only in couert and in her ſtomacke, but more openly in the preſence of her huſbande, ſhewing euidently that ſhe had the attaint of ielouſly. This notwithſtanding, <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>piter</hi> was neuertheleſſe deſirous for to ſée <hi>Danae</hi> more then hée was before. The maleditions ne curſes might not let ne withdrawe his affections which grewe more and more. In the end he found himſelf ſo rauiſhed with her loue that there was no more continence found in him. To conclude, hée deuiſed intencions and concluſions, and purpoſed to go vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the guardiens and kéepers of the Damoſell <hi>Danae,</hi> and that he would beare vnto them ſo largely and ſo many ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of golde and Iewels, with money of golde, that hée would turne them with his giftes to accorde to him, and let him enter into the tower of <hi>Danaes.</hi> Then hée ſente for the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:7118:50"/>
Iewellers, that were woont to ſerue his father <hi>Saturne,</hi> and made them make the moſt rich Iewels and Owches that were euer ſéene or thought. When the workmen had made a part, <hi>Iupiter</hi> tooke them, and laded him therewith, and euill cloathed like as he had béene a ſeruant, he alone depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from <hi>Crete,</hi> and drewe him to <hi>Argos,</hi> the moſt ſecretlie that he might, and ſo went and came ſéeking the Tower of <hi>Dardan.</hi> Which he found in an euening, and ſaw the wals ſhining, and came vnto the gate, where he found many of the matrones ſitting at the doore, for recreation, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Iupiter</hi> was comen, he ſaluted the Matrones, and ſaid vnto them: Noble dames, the good night come to you. What Tower is this, of ſo noble and ſo ſtrong faſhion? Fayre ſonne, ſaid the eldeſt of them, ye be not of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, foraſmuch as ye knowe not the name of this Tower. Know ye certainly that it is named the Tower of <hi>Dardain,</hi> and this is the proper place that the king <hi>Acriſius</hi> hath cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to make for to keepe his daughter the virgin <hi>Danae</hi> in, which is a Damoſell ſo furniſhed with all vertues and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable maners, that her like is not in all this world: But, the poore maid is ſo much infortunate, that her father <hi>Acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> holdeth her in this Tower ſhut, for that he hath an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere of his goddes, that of his daughter <hi>Danae</hi> ſhould bee borne a childe that ſhould turne him into a ſtone. This is cauſe wherefore we be and kéepe her that no man may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe with her in no faſhio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And her father is the king <hi>Acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius,</hi> which is ſo ſore ſmitten to the heart with iealouſie, that if he knew of your being here, he would ſende to deſtroy you. And therefore withdrawe you, and go foorth on your way. <hi>Iupiter</hi> hearing the anſwere of the woman, gaue no regard vnto her words, ſauing that he heard with his eares: for he employed his eyes vnto the marking of the Tower: and ſéeing that it was impregnable for anie aſſault, as well for the ſtrength of the place where it was founded on, as for that it was nigh the Citie of <hi>Argos,</hi> which was right ſtrong: he conſidered in himſelfe, that for to come and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:7118:51"/>
ſée this mayde he coulde not obtaine but by the meane of theſe women. And then thus he aunſwered to the old wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: I thanke you of your good aduertiſement: I am much beholden vnto you, but I ſhall yet ſay more vnto you, if it pleaſe you, I am ſent vnto the damoſels of this place from the right mightie king <hi>Iupiter</hi> of <hi>Crete,</hi> for to deliuer to them certaine preſents on his behalfe, Wherefore I pray you, that it pleaſe you to giue mee aſſiſtaunce to ſpeake with them. When the olde matrone vnderſtoode of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and that he brought preſents vnto the Damoſels: ſhe aunſwered him, that he was right welcome, and made him to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a little Chamber (which was by the gate, for to ſpeake therein to their friends when they came to viſit them.) And then ſhe went into the chamber of <hi>Danae,</hi> and there aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled all the women of the place, and ſayde vnto them. My fellowes, the King <hi>Iupiter</hi> of <hi>Crete</hi> gréeteth you well by one of his ſeruants, whom I haue put into the Chambret of the gate: he hath ſayde to me, that he hath brought certaine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents. Sée ye nowe whether ye will receyue them or not: and what I ſhall anſwere to the meſſenger, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The Damoſels were right ioyous and glad, when they heard theſe tydings, and tooke their councell togither, and concluded, that they would take and receiue theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents of the king <hi>Iupiter.</hi> Then they deſcended into the chambret, and feaſted the meſſenger, which did them reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and ſaide to them: Ladies, and Damoſels, your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowme is ſo great, that it hath moued the king <hi>Iupiter</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire your loue. In ſigne of which, he hath ſent to you of his Iewels, and prayeth you to receiue them in good part, and he recommendeth him vnto the right noble grace of your Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe the kings daughter. With theſe wordes <hi>Iupiter</hi> ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his ſacke of leather, wherein were his Iewels, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered them vnto the damſels: When they had receiued, and ſaw them what they were, they were all abaſhed for to ſée things ſo precious, and ſayd that they would go and ſhewe them to their Miſtreſſe. And foorth they went vp into the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:7118:51" rendition="simple:additions"/>
tower, and ſhewed their preſents vnto <hi>Danae:</hi> ſignifying to her, that the king <hi>Iupiter</hi> recommended him vnto her noble grace. As ſoone as this noble virgin had ſéene theſe Iewels, ſhe ſaide, that it muſt néedes be that <hi>Iupiter</hi> was rich and liberall: and ſaid moreouer, that the gift that he had giuen was more of value then all the Realme of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gos:</hi> and alſo, that ſhe would that the man that had brought theſe Iewels, where feaſted as it appertaineth, and alſo wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led that <hi>Iupiter</hi> ſhould be thanked in her name. Then the Damoſels by the commandement of <hi>Danae,</hi> went to feaſt the meſſenger of king <hi>Iupiter,</hi> the beſt wiſe that they might, the moſt part of the night in eating and drinking. And then came the aged woman that had firſt ſpoken with him, and ſaide to him: My ſonne, the maiden <hi>Danae</hi> thanketh the king <hi>Iupiter</hi> of the courteſie that it hath pleaſed him to do her Damoſelles: and, ſhée taketh her ſelfe greatly behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to him, and to you that haue taken the paine to bring them: and if there may pleaſe you any thing héerein, ſpare not this houſe.</p>
                     <p>Dame (anſwered <hi>Iupiter</hi>) ye do mee too much honour by the one halfe: if there bee any thing in <hi>Crete</hi> to your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, aſke you it, and certainely ye ſhall haue it with good heart. And thus they talked ſo long that it was time to withdraw him thence. <hi>Iupiter</hi> tooke leaue of the damoſelles, and concluded that he would returne into his countrey, on the morrow early. What ſhall I ſay more? <hi>Iupiter</hi> tooke this night as much reſt as he might, and had the heart ſo ſurpriſed, that he awoke more then he néeded: for the houre was not come that he attended to ſpeake to <hi>Danae.</hi> He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned ſecretly into <hi>Crete,</hi> and cauſed to be made newe iewels much more rich and more precious then the other were, for to go againe, and preſent to the damoſels. And as ſoone as was to him poſſible, he gathered iewels together as many as would loade an horſe. After this; on a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning early he loaded an horſe with theſe iewels, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wéeting of any perſon, with the ſame he ſo laboured on his way, that without any hinderance hee came vnto the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:7118:52"/>
tower. And there aſſembled the damoſels, and did them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence, and ſaide to them. Ladies and damoſels, the king <hi>Iupiter</hi> hath you ſo in his grace, that knowing by the report of me, what feaſting and welcome ye made lately for his iewels: hee hath ſent vnto you other, and in his name I preſent to you theſe iewels that I haue nowe brought: praying that the preſent may be acceptable and wel thought of: and that it pleaſe you to do ſo much vnto your miſtreſſe that I might a little ſpeake with her, for to aduertiſe her, if it pleaſe her, of certaine ſecret things that touch her, and wherewith I am charged by <hi>Iupiter.</hi>

When the maide <hi>Danaes</hi> had heard the words and the tidings of the olde woman, ſhe was right penſiſe: but for all that, ſhe ſpared not to ſay that, that her heart iudged beſt: and thus anſwered.

It is a ſmall matter for his ſeruant to ſpeake a word with me.

                     <p>Faire ſonne, anſwered the old woman, ye ſpeake ſo ſwéete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that we may not nor can giue vnto you the refuſe of your requeſt. We dare well affye, and truſt in you. Alas dame (anſwered <hi>Iupiter</hi>) doubt you? When I ſhall fault againſt you or any other, I wiſh to be ſmitten with the thunder and tempeſt. I would verily that ye had the prerogatiue to know my inward thoughtes, to the end that in iudging of my mind yee might be aſſured of mee, not to haue by my cauſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny inconuenience. With theſe words, <hi>Iupiter</hi> drew to his will the olde woman, and all the Damoſels as well by his ſubtil language as by his riches. For to vſe ſhort proceſſe, the olde woman accorded to <hi>Iupiter,</hi> that he ſhall haue the grace to ſpeake with the mayde, and brought him before her, with all his preſents: <hi>Iupiter</hi> had then more ioy then I can write.</p>
                     <p>And when he was thus aboue in the towre of <hi>Dardane,</hi> in beholding the ample beauty of <hi>Danae</hi> his ioy doubled, and he knew her well by her beautie, and made vnto her reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, ſaying. Right noble &amp; accompliſhed damoſell, the king <hi>Iupiter</hi> ſaluteth you by me, and ſendeth vnto the women of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:7118:53"/>
this houſe, of ſuch goddes as fortune hath giuen to him: if it be your pleaſure they ſhall receiue them: and after I will ſaye vnto you certayn things ſecrete, which the king <hi>Iupiter</hi> your ſeruaunt, hath charged me to faye vnto you. My fréende anſwered <hi>Danae,</hi> ſauing your honour the King, <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi> is not my ſeruaunt, but I my ſelfe am beholden to him, and am his ſeruant, and thanke him of his bounty: it ſéemeth as he had reygned golde in this place. It is acceptable to me that the women of this tower haue your preſents. And it pleaſeth me well alſo to heare your charge, to the ende that King <hi>Iupiter,</hi> ſhould not ſay that I were vnkinde, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The matrons and the Damoſels were preſent at this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, <hi>Iupiter</hi> deliuered vnto them his Iewels which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued with great galdnes. After that <hi>Danae</hi> tooke the meſſenger by the hand, and led him a parte vnto the beddes ſide, where ſhe made him to leane by her. And then when <hi>Iupiter</hi> founde himſelfe all alone with <hi>Danae</hi> he ſayde vnto her: right noble Damoſell, I no more call you Damoſell, but Lady: For ye are my lady and my only myſtres, which haue mayſtred mine heart, and alſo haue ouercome me vnder the ſownd and bruit of your glorious reports &amp; name. For to aduertiſe you, verily I am <hi>Iupiter,</hi> of whome now I haue ſpoken to you at the preſentation of the iewels, and it is truth, that it is not long fithen, when I was in my Realme, for to heare reported the maner how your Father helde you ſhutte in this Tower (with litle good that maye accorde vnto your honoure) as well for to gette your thanke and grace, as for pittie wherewith I was moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, I haue deliberated in my heart to employe my ſelfe vnto your deliueraunce, and alſo for to gette your grace. And for to execute this deliberation, I haue taken parte of my treſours, and haue come hither to preſent them vnto your Damoſels, and ſo departed: and of newe am comen again, in hope to haue your loue, whereof I am wel content and thanke mercy and fortune. Alas madame, if I be ſo hardy as for to haue put my ſelf in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> adue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture of my life for to ſhew the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:7118:54"/>
great loue that I haue to you. Excuſe me, if I haue enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed a thing ſo hie that I ne me holde worthie to attaine, but in the affiance of fortune, and inſomuch as ſhée will fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour in this partie. Madame then in conſideration of my wordes, ye may ſée my life, or my death, and yee onely may lightly make the iudgement. If your humilitie condiſcend in the knowledge of pitie that I haue had of you, expoſing my ſelfe into the daunger, where I might bee ſure, I am nowe nigh the ieopardie which ye may ſaue: and if not I yéelde me your priſoner. Certes, the ſhining reſplendiſſour of your renowmed beautie, whereof the méede paſſeth the renowme and the triumph of your incomparable excellency, hath enraged mine heart, and brought me hither into the priſon of your will. Alas Madame, behold, and ſée with your eyes full of ſwéetneſſe, and of clemencie, mee which ſée not at this tyme, but languiſh for fault of reſt in continuall tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, in furies redoubled, and in ſighes vpon ſighes, which may not be puruaied of remedie, but by your benignitie and amorous good will.</p>
                     <p>At the beginning of the firſt recommendation that was made of you in my preſence, and at the poynt that I enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed to deliuer you out of this Tower, I beheld my ſelfe right ioyfull and happie, becauſe of ſo hie an enterpriſe: but ſéeing the perils that I finde my ſelfe in ſince, I wote ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer what I may ſay of my ſelfe. For by moneth vpon mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, wéeke vpon wéeke, and day vpon day, your name hath had domination on me. And oft times hath conſtrained mée to be rauiſhed, and yet more in a traunce by deſire to ſpeake to you, and to imagine howe I ſhould come to the poynt where I nowe am, and not onelie in this, but alſo to finde mercie in you. And I pray and require you right hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, that the amourous gift of mercie ye will to me accord, and thus doing, ye ſhall do mercie to your ſelfe, and haue pitie of your yong daies, which you haue conſented to looſe by the fooliſh fantaſies of the king your father. Ye know well that (his life during) he will not ſuffer you to be married to
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:7118:54"/>
any man. It is poſſible that your father ſhall liue as long as you, for he is ſtrong of members, hard and boyſtrous. Alſo ye ought conceyue if ye will beléeue me, that your life hath no wealth nor pleaſance. Onely the pleaſances come vnto the people by the ſight, and by beholding of diuerſe things. The women ſingularly haue their principall pleaſures in their huſbands, and in their generation and lynages. Ye may come here to, but then ye muſt haue mercie on your ſelfe. Is it not in your conceyte and knowledge that no man hath but his life in this world? Foraſmuch as ye obey and yéeld to the fooliſh commaundement of your father the King <hi>Acriſius,</hi> ye ſhall be a woman loſt: being in this place, it is not poſſible to take and haue patience. This is too hard a thing vnto a yong heart to be put in priſon without demerite. I knowe the humaine affections, and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande that natually euerie creature loueth his profite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the profite of another. This is agaynſt your proſperitie and vtilitie, from which ye be ſhut here within. Howe may ye haue loue vnto him which is cauſe of two euils? The leſſe euill is to bee choſen, ſince that you féele you condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned here vnto the ende of the dayes of your father. Doubt ye not but his ende is oft deſired to his death, for your ſake: and his death may not bee effected without great charge of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. Me thinketh that better it were for you in diuerſe conſiderations to finde way to iſſue and go out of this place, and to take to huſband ſome noble &amp; puiſſant man, that wold enterpriſe to carrie you away ſecretelie for to be his wife in his Countrey. By this meane ye ſhall be deliuered from the paine that ye be in: ye may eſchew the death of your father, and leſſe euill yee ſhould doo in breaking his fooliſh com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, then to abyde in the poynt where hee hath put you. Madame, alas thinke ye here on for your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and health: (as I haue ſayde vnto you) I am your ſeruaunt, and if it pleaſe you to depart from this place, ye ſhall finde no man readier then I am: for to kéepe you, and to ſaue you, I giue my ſelfe vnto your noble commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:7118:55"/>
for to furniſh your will to my power, as he that bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth alway the remembrance of you in the moſt déepeſt place of my mind: in ſléeping I ſée you, and waking I thinke on you. I haue had neuer reſt in my ſelfe, nor neuer ſhall haue, but if it pleaſe you. My fortune, my deſtinie, my happe and vnhap come of you. If yee take me vnto your mercie, and that I finde grace with you, I ſhall bée the moſt happieſt of all happie. And if ye do otherwiſe, it may be ſayde that among all vnhappie, none ſhall go before me. But if ſuch fortune ſhall come to me by your ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, I will take it in patience, for the nobleneſſe that I ſée in you alway, I require you that my heart be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued ne put from your heart, for as much as it toucheth me nearely. All the tongues of men can not ſay, nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the quantitie of the loue that I haue in you, no more then they can pronounce by proper name, all the ſtarres of heauen. By this loue I am alway in thoughts, labours, in ſighs, anguiſhes, and often times in great feare and doubt. At this houre I wot not whether I liue or not, becauſe me thinketh I am héere for to receiue abſolution, or a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall ſentence. Theſe things conſidered, alas will not ye haue him in your grace, that for to deſerue your loue and mercy, hath abandoned and aduentured his life, as ye may ſée, leauing his royall eſtate, the better to kéepe his cauſe ſecret. Vnto an hart wel vnderſtanding, few words ſuffice. For concluſion, I pray you to giue your heart vnto him that hath giuen his heart vnto you: and that ye prouide from henceforth for the ill caſe ye now be in, after the common iudgement.</p>
                     <p>With this, <hi>Iupiter</hi> held his peace, and kept ſilence, and lent his eares for to heare what ſhould be the anſwere of <hi>Danae.</hi> The right noble damoſell, when ſhe had heard his talke, which ſhe had ſore noted: and whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhe ſaw that he had giuen her ſpace to ſpeake, ſhe was reſolued, and changed co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and ſaid to him.

But when I have conſidered, and underſtood, and ſéen viſibly, that the <hi>Argiens</hi> would defame mée to perpetuity, and that my Father would ſend mée where mine honour ſhould ſtrongly be abaſed and put underfoot, by your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per declaration, I will in no wiſe deal hardly with you, neither ſhall you have any diſturbance for my cauſe.

that nameth himſelfe ſeruant of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> is <hi>Iupiter</hi> himſelfe (by report) and hath made great oaths, that hee hath made theſe preſents and gifts for to ſpeake to me.

                     <p>The old woman had béen before time in the houſe of king <hi>Meliſeus,</hi> and there had ſéene <hi>Iupiter</hi> in the time of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from his conqueſt of <hi>Archadie,</hi> and had partly knowne him ſince the firſt day that he came thither. This notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, ſhe doubted of his perſon, for as much as men o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwhile be like one to another, and ſhe had alway her eie on him. When then ſhe had vnderſtood by <hi>Danae,</hi> that had told her that he was <hi>Iupiter,</hi> ſhe was ſure that it was he in his perſon, and had great ioy, ſaying. My daughter, certainely I know him that we ſpeake of, and haue talked with him of long time paſt. And for his perſon I aſſure you, it is hee that he hath done you to vnderſtand of. But for to perſwade or counſell you, if yee take him vnto your huſband, I can ſay none otherwiſe to you, but that hee is one of the moſt valianteſt men of the world, and that his enterpriſes bee right high. And if I had a daughter the moſt beſt manered of the world, there is no man liuing that I would giue her ſooner vnto, then to him, if it pleaſed him to take hir. Ye ſée that notwithſtanding his ſimple aray, hee is a goodly man, hee is noble, hee is rich, hee is wiſe, hée is a king. Ye feele in your ſelfe your courage, if ye will vſe and obſerue the commandement of your father, ye may not with him holde conſiſtorie ne parlement.

                     <p>Ah my mother (ſayd <hi>Danae</hi>) howe ſhould I chooſe my ſelfe? there is in me neither wit, nor reaſon to take that I ſhould chooſe, ne for to diſcerne the good from the euill. And as for me, I ſhall put it all into your deliberation, and will that yee knowe that out of this Tower would I faine be, (mine honour ſaued, and the honour ſaued of my companie.) With this came in to them all the damoſes of the houſe, and ſaid to her, that they had made right good chéere to their gueſt: and thus failed the ſecret conference of <hi>Danae,</hi> &amp; of the aged woman. The damoſels went &amp; ſet their iewels, newly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to them, and parted to each of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her portion, ſaying: that to king <hi>Iupiter</hi> was none like, but that he was among al other the moſt bountifull, &amp; moſt honorable king of kings.</p>

When all was doone hée de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined in himſelfe to aſſay if he might come to the ende of his thought, and arayed and clothed himſelfe, and went out of his chamber vnto the tower, where he ſawe the doore open to his ſéeming, and finding it true that it was open, hée went vp as ſoftly as he could that he ſhould not be heard, and came ſo far that he came to the chamber of <hi>Danae,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the doore was open: in which chamber was a lampe bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. <hi>Iupiter</hi> all full of gladnes put his head into the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, to behold if the damoſels had bin with <hi>Danae:</hi> and when hée had beholden that there was none, but that <hi>Danae</hi> was alone, in her bed: he aduentured him to go vnto her, where he founde her ſléeping, and awooke her by kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Danae</hi> was ſo ſore abaſhed, when ſhe felt her ſelfe ſo kill, that ſhe crept within the bed. <hi>Iupiter</hi> drewe néerer, ſo that he diſcouered her face for to ſpeake to her, whereof ſhée be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing afrayd, opened her eyes, and when ſhée wiſt that it was <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and that he was alone by her bed ſide, ſhe made a right great ſhrych and cry. When <hi>Iupiter</hi> heard this cry, he was much troubled: neuertheleſſe he purpoſed to aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, turning her to him warde, and comforting her by his ſwéete ſpeaking, he declared to her in the ende that it muſt néedes be that ſhe muſt be his wife, promiſing to come and to fetch her in ſhort time. And ſo long he helde her in ſuch talke, that he vnclothed himſelfe, and in ſpeaking to her he ſprang into the bed, and laye by her ſide, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that ſhe with ſayd and wit-ſtoode it with all her might. Then ſayde the mayde, that ſhe was betrayed. And wée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping tenderly ſhe wende to haue fledde, and did her beſte to haue gone awaye. But <hi>Iupiter</hi> tooke good héede, and at the leape that ſhe ſuppoſed to make, caught and held her by the arme, and made her to lye downe agayne, and he clypt her and kiſte her againe. And ſo appeaſed her in ſuch facion
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:7118:59"/>
that ſhe left her wéeping. And on the morning when he roſe vp from her, he left her with child with a yong ſonne. What ſhall I ſay more, <hi>Iupiter</hi> by this hardineſſe atchieued his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and his will on fayre <hi>Danae,</hi> and made the peace for his offence. The night paſſed ouer, and the day came, that <hi>Iupiter</hi> muſt néedes ariſe and depart from her, and then by neceſſitie conſtrayning him to kéepe the honour of <hi>Danae,</hi> he aroſe, and tooke his clothing truſſed togither, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned into his Chamber, where he went to bed, and ſlept ſo faſt and ſurely, that he awooke not till the houre and time to go to dinner.</p>
                     <p>At this houre <hi>Danae</hi> aſked where was the Meſſenger of king <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and ſaid that ſhe would eate with him, and that they ſhould bring him vp into the Tower ſecretlie. With the worde of <hi>Danae,</hi> two Damoſels went downe out of the Tower into the Chamber of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and finding him aſléepe, awooke him, whereof he was amazed and aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. For the Sunne was that tyme mounted hie. And then he aroſe, and arayed him haſtily, when he wiſt that <hi>Danae</hi> had ſent for him to come ſpeake with her. And ſo came to her, which began to waxe red, and to looſe her colour, &amp; coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, when ſhe ſaw him. And the reuerence made, they went and eate togither, and made great cheare: yet <hi>Danae</hi> was aſhamed, and was ſtrongly ſurpriſed for the caſe that was happened to her: and ſhe might not abſtaine to ſet her eyes on the beautie of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> which alſo fayled not on his ſide to beholde her by ſo ardent deſire, that the eyes of the one and the other pearced each other oftentymes. In this beholding they paſſed part of the tyme of the dinner. When they had taken their refection, <hi>Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Danae</hi> drewe them apart, and helde a long parliament of their worke. And it was concluded betwéene them, that <hi>Iupiter</hi> ſhould go into the Countrey, and that he ſhould returne thither with a certaine number of people, for to take away the faire <hi>Danae.</hi> And with this concluſion, <hi>Iupiter</hi> departed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned into <hi>Crete,</hi> leauing <hi>Danae</hi> in the Tower, of whome

                     <p>This noble king <hi>Troos,</hi> had in his company two ſonnes, of whome the eldeſt was called <hi>Ilion</hi> to whome came downe from heauen the Palladium.

And they ſignified their intencion by the riders, vnto their father <hi>Troos.</hi> After this they withdrew them to take a little their reſt, and gaue charge to them that kept the watch, to awake them when they ſawe their time: and ſo they had but little reſted, when they were awaked and called, and that each man ſhould take his armes and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low on.

                        <hi>Ganimedes</hi> and <hi>Pelops</hi> encountred together, and full of great courages they fought together, ſo ſore and hard, that a great while, by the wounds that were ſéene vppon their heads and vpon their armes, they were like the one to ſlea the other, and the one had ſlaine the other, had not <hi>Tantalus</hi> and <hi>Ilion</hi> haue béene by.

                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter this foreſaid battaile, when <hi>Tanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> was withdrawen, hee beganne to caſt his eyes vppon his people, which were all on a hill, for to wit how they were of number, and howe they had borne themſelues, and how much peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple he had loſt: and he went all about them with his ſon <hi>Pelops,</hi> and him ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med well that his power was made leſſe than hee had thought, whereof hee had in his heart a right great and ſharpe diſpleaſure, and viſiting his hoſt in this faſhion, the day began to ariſe: and in the dawning, two things appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and came to the knowledge of the people of <hi>Tantalus:</hi> one was the great loſſe of his people, and the other was, the battaile with King <hi>Troos,</hi> that they ſaw from farre diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered and approach. Certes, when <hi>Tantalus</hi> conſidered his euident damage, and ſawe that his enemies, becauſe of the ſuccours that came to them, were ſtronger then he was,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:7118:62"/>
he found not in the reſolution of his enterpriſe but diſpaire and ſhamefull end, and all diſcomforted, he called his ſonne and his principal friendes, and demaunded them what was beſt to do. They counſelled him that hee ſhould labour to ſaue himſelfe, and ſaide to him, if he abode, and attended the <hi>Troyans,</hi> that would be cauſe of his deſtruction, and of all them that were left of his people.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Tantalus</hi> vnderſtood this, and knew that hee was deſperate, and nigh his ſhamefull ende and flight, and aboue that, that he might not extinguiſh and put downe the name of <hi>Troy:</hi> hee tooke himſelfe by the beard that was long, and impatiently ſaid, ſmiting himſelfe with his fiſt: O curſed enuie, thou didſt promiſe mee of late to put <hi>Troy</hi> vnder my féete, and haſt made me to riſe preſumptuouſly againſt her: Nowe ſée I well the contrarie, and that by mee <hi>Troy</hi> ſhall flouriſh: and that more is, by my cauſe her name ſhall growe and ſhall be enchaunſed, and that all kings ſhall tremble before her, in my ſight and behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. O falſe traiterours fortune, accurſed be thou, that I euer beléeued on thée. Theſe words finiſhed, hee ſaide to his ſon and to other of his councell, that they ſhould cauſe his people to withdraw a little and a little. At laſt he commaunded that each man ſhould ſaue himſelfe, and then they put them all to flight. <hi>Ilion</hi> and <hi>Ganimedes</hi> tooke héede and ranne after, and chaſed them out of the territories of <hi>Troy,</hi> with great occiſon, and ſlaughter of the people of the <hi>Frigiens.</hi> And after that they had chaſed them, they ſaid that they had doone them ſhame inough, and left worke and returned, and came anon and met the king <hi>Troos</hi> their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that followed them: which had great ioy, when hée ſaw that they had quit them ſo well vpon his enemies, by the good conduct of his two ſonnes.</p>
                     <p>The ioy then that <hi>Troos</hi> made <hi>Ilion</hi> and <hi>Ganimedes</hi> after the battaile, was great and of good loue. <hi>Troos</hi> brought them again vnto <hi>Troy</hi> with great worſhip. The <hi>Troyans</hi> men and women receiued them worſhipfully, &amp; bleſſed the womb
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:7118:63"/>
that had borne them, and the breaſts that gaue them ſucke. Theſe were two noble ſons of the King, of whom the names were borne into all the Marches there aboutes, with ſo great a bruit and noyſe, that not onelie the neighbours of <hi>Troos</hi> came to make alliaunce with King <hi>Troos</hi> and the <hi>Troyans:</hi> but there came alſo Kings of many far Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys of the Eaſt, which could not magnifie inough the puiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance of the king, and of the citie of <hi>Troy,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>In theſe dayes when <hi>Troy</hi> ſhewed the rayes of her puiſſance and nobleneſſe through the vniuerſall world, <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne</hi> late king of <hi>Crete,</hi> ſayled by the ſeas with little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie, not as king and poſſeſſor of the realme, but as bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and diſpurueyed of all land and countrey, ſo poore that he had no place to withdraw him to, nor wiſt not whither to go, but onely by deſarts, and by the depth of the ſea. When he had béene in this poynt a great while, thinking without end, how he might perſecute his ſon <hi>Iupiter,</hi> fortune brought him into the ſea of <hi>Helleſpont,</hi> and then beholding about him, he eſpyed and ſawe <hi>Troy,</hi> which was a Citie paſſing fayre and rich, and of marueylous greatneſſe. And then what for to take him a little reſt, as for to put away his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholie, and for to reuittaile his ſhippe, and people, hee ſayled and rowed into the Citie, and landed at the port. When the <hi>Troyans</hi> had ſeene the ſhippe of <hi>Saturne,</hi> that was better, and more of value then all the ſhippes that they had euer ſéene, the maiſters of the ſhips of <hi>Troy,</hi> went haſtily vnto the King <hi>Troos,</hi> and ſaid: Sir, bee of good cheare, and make readie your houſe, I aſſure you that there is come right now vnto your port, the moſt rich ſhip that euer was ſéene on the ſea, and me ſéemeth this conſidered, that in ſo noble a ſhip, muſt be ſome noble or great earthly Lord that commeth vnto you, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Anon as king <hi>Troos</hi> heard theſe tidings of the maiſter mariner, he deſired to ſée ſo fayre a ſhippe, and accompanied with his two ſonnes, went for to ſée at the port, and to feaſt them of the ſtraunge ſhippe. This king <hi>Troos</hi> was
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:7118:63"/>
courteous and honourable. When he came vnto the port, he found that <hi>Saturne</hi> made readie his ſhippe, and diſpoſed him for to go vnto the citie. And ſéeing the ſhip, he maruai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led much: for the vtenſils that were within were richly made: furthermore, <hi>Saturne</hi> &amp; his companions were armed, and had no mariners. He beheld their behauiour at his comming, and knew that they were men of warre right well in point: ſo he thought in himſelfe at the beginning for to arme himſelfe, and to ſend for the <hi>Troyans:</hi> But after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, when hee had ſéene their little number, and that no ſhip followed nor came after theſe ſtrangers from the coaſt, he changed his purpoſe, viewed and approched vnto the ſhip, and called <hi>Saturne</hi> that moſt beſt was arayed aboue the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and aſked him what he ſought, both he and his fellows, and from what nation they were? and whence they came from? And <hi>Saturne</hi> anſwered to him and ſaide. Sir, albeit I know not at what port I am arriued: for as much as my heart giueth me that ye be courteous of your nature, I will not hide nor couer any thing touching your requeſt, I was late king of <hi>Crete,</hi> named <hi>Saturne:</hi> now I am but <hi>Saturne,</hi> for my ſonne hath put me out ſorrowfully, ſo that of all the riches of all my people, and all my goods temporall, there is nothing left me but this onely ſhip that ye may ſée. Wherefore I pray you, and require, that it pleaſe you to direct mee to ſome Lord of this countrey, to the end that I may require licence and leaue to enter into his lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and to take that, that ſhall be neceſſarie competently to the life of me and of my companie.</p>
                     <p>When king <hi>Troos</hi> heard the caſe of <hi>Saturne</hi> compriſed in briefe words, he ſaide to him by compaſſion. King <hi>Saturne,</hi> yee be welcome into the houſe of <hi>Troos:</hi> in troth I haue great gréefe in my ſelfe of your firſt anoyance, for your glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious renowme, and for the goodneſſe that is in you, as often times I haue heard it recounted. But with this anoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance two things gladde and ioye my heart, the one procée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the accompliſhment of deſire, for I haue deſired
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:7118:64"/>
manye dayes for to ſée you, and this deſire is now accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in me: and the other procéedeth of hope, and in this part I ſaye to you, that I king of this countrey haue intention to comfort and to councell you to my power, and alſo to giue you ſo good ayde, that ye ſhall correcte your ſonne, and ſhall puniſhe his perſonne, in ſuche wiſe as it ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertayne for his offence. <hi>Saturne</hi> began to ſighe, and to take a lyttle comforte of the greate proffer and good chéere that the King <hi>Troos</hi> made to him, and he thanked him of ſo hie and ample offers, and at the coming out of his ſhippe he b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

What ſhall I ſaye? the King <hi>Troos</hi> brought him into his Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace with all his men, and feaſted them as it appertayned, for the loue of <hi>Saturne.</hi> In likewiſe, the people being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſed of <hi>Saturne,</hi> that it was he that found the maner of labouring of the earth, of melting of metals, and of ſayling, and rowing by Sea, made ſo greate and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull feaſt at his comming, that they coulde no more doo. At that time, during this feaſting, when <hi>Saturne</hi> felt him in the grace of the <hi>Troyans,</hi> on a daye he called <hi>Troos</hi> and his two ſonnes, and addreſſed his words to them ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Lordes of <hi>Troye,</hi> ye haue doone ſo much for me, that I maye neuer deſerue it: but as I haue ſayde to you, my ſonne is enhaunſed and lift vp aboue me, and hath taken from me my Realme. I intreate you, as much as I may, that ye will councell me what thing is moſt conuenient for me to doo. And how I ſhall ſuffer and beare the iniury doon to me. &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>My brother (aunſwered the King <hi>Troos</hi>) this is againſt nature for a ſonne himſelfe to rebell againſt his Father: the ſinne and crime is foule and worthy of reprehenſion, for eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſonne is bounden by all lawes to ſerue, worſhip, dread and obey his Father. And it is not reaſon that any man ſhould approoue or hold with a ſonne diſobeyſant. Your ſonne is in this condition curſed and right euill: and I am of the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ye ſhal not acquite you well, vnleſſe you do to your pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

And to the end ye ſhall not excuſe your euident harmes and loſſes, when ye will, I will deliuer you my ſonne <hi>Ganimedes,</hi> accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with twentie thouſand <hi>Troyans,</hi> that ſhall ſuccour you, vnto the death. Or they ſhall ſette you agayne in your royall tribunall. <hi>Saturne</hi> was all recomforted, when he knewe the loue that the King <hi>Troos</hi> ſhewed to him: and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter many thankes, concluded, that he would returne into <hi>Crete</hi> with <hi>Ganimedes,</hi> and would begin againe the piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous warre of him and of his ſonne.

                     <p>AT that houre when <hi>Saturne</hi> arriued in <hi>Crete,</hi> the ſunne was turned into the weſt, and on the heauen bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare the ſtars. <hi>Saturne</hi> knewe the port, and tooke land hoping to enter y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> country ſecretly, and went a little way, and there lodged his people in a place co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reſt, &amp;

But they were not farre gone, but anon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſunne ryſing, and approaching a ſtraight paſſage, the eſpies and ſcowrers came vnto <hi>Saturne,</hi> and <hi>Ganimedes</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtily, and tolde them that they had ſéene the King <hi>Iupiter</hi> right ſtrongly accompanied, which kept the paſſage. Vpon this place, it is to wit, that when <hi>Iupiter</hi> was departed from <hi>Danae,</hi> and from the Tower of <hi>Dardan,</hi> and was come into <hi>Crete,</hi> deſiring to accompliſh his promiſe to <hi>Danae,</hi> hee did cauſe to aſſemble his men of warre, concluding in himſelfe, that faithfully he would go fetch the fayre <hi>Danae,</hi> and bring her into his Countrey by force of armes. What ſhall I ſay more? His armie was all readie, and came the ſame night where on the morrow he hoped to haue departed, but as hée was in his bed that night in his Citie of <hi>Parthenie,</hi> tidings came to him, of the arryuing of the <hi>Troyans.</hi> Wherefore he was conſtrained by force to change his purpoſe: of which he was right ſorie and maruailous paſſing heauie. This notwithſtanding, ſuddenly as theſe tydings were freſhly brought vnto him, he aroſe and tooke his men of armes that he had aſſembled, and haſtily brought them vnto the ſtraight whereof aboue is written, and there abode his enemies, as wiſe &amp; well aduiſed. And it is not to be forgotten, that in this armie among his men, was the king of <hi>Moloſſe,</hi> which had late found the induſtrie and craft to tame and breake horſes, for to be ridden, and to ride them. And there was come he and his men, to ſerue the king <hi>Iupiter</hi> for his good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowme, accompanied with an hundred men that ran as the winde. And for this cauſe they were called <hi>Centaures:</hi> and theſe <hi>Centaures</hi> were ſo terrible, and cruell, that they doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not the puiſſance of King, nor of none other whatſoeuer they were.</p>
                     <p>For then to returne to the matter alreadie begun: when <hi>Saturne</hi> knewe that the paſſage was kept, and that <hi>Iupiter</hi> was then aduertiſed of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming, he cauſed his hoſt to ſtay,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:7118:65"/>
and ſayde vnto them: My children, it behooueth that this morning, ye ſo do in <hi>Crete</hi> your deuoir, not onely in mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring and ſhewing your courages, but aboue all, that ye bee redoubted and dread like the thunder, Aſſure year ſelues of your quarrell, <hi>Iupiter</hi> mine enemie is heere, where he abydeth our comming to the battaile ordained: if we will come to the ende of our enterpriſe, it is neceſſarie that we draw thither. Let me heare what ye will ſay. Then thus anſwered <hi>Ganimedes:</hi> we be come into <hi>Crete,</hi> for to correct your ſonne, and to ſet you againe in your throne. We will do that we may do by our power, and fight fréely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubting or feare. And vnto the ende that no reproch be layde vnto vs, I will ſende and ſummon your ſonne, firſt or any ſwoorde be drawne or ſtroke ſmitten, to the ende that he yéelde him vnto your obeyſaunce: and that he come and amende his miſdéedes. And then <hi>Ganimedes</hi> did call forth his <hi>Troians</hi> by conſent of <hi>Saturne,</hi> and ſet them in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of battaile: and when he had ſo done, he ſent one of his auncient knights, a noble man vnto <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and gaue him charge to make the ſummons, ſuch as is ſayde before. The <hi>Troyan</hi> departed from the hoſt, at the commaundement of <hi>Ganimedes,</hi> and did ſo much that hee was preſented be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and ſaid to him, <hi>Iupiter,</hi> thou oughteſt to know that euery ſonne oweth obeyſance vnto his father: thou doſt contrarie to theſe things, and ſheweſt that thou art not ſon of a king, but of perdition, for thou deſpiſeſt thy father: In ſtead of reuerence, thou haſt him in hate: and thou ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt him warre where thou ſhouldeſt hold him in loue: and thou putteſt him to great diſhonor thy ſelfe, where thou art hold and bounden to do him worſhip. O <hi>Iupiter,</hi> who ſhall giue thée abſolution of thy life, dwelling in venome? Who ſhall excuſe thy ſinne? Thou art enemie of thy father. The caſe is ſo grieuous, that there is no mercie ne excuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, vnleſſe it procéede from the naturall clementie of thy father. Beholde <hi>Iupiter,</hi> beholde the ende of thine inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. All lawe poſitiue, and all lawe written, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:7118:66"/>
thée vnto death, and curſe and anathematiſe thée. It is great pittie, thou art a goodly yong man. Know that thy reigne may not long dure: and that thou ſhalt more ſharply be puniſhed then thou wéeneſt peraduenture at this this time. For <hi>Ganimedes</hi> one of the ſonnes of <hi>Troy</hi> is hereby in the helpe of <hi>Saturne</hi> thy father, with twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſighting men, which ſummoneth thée by me, that thou returne into the mercie of thy father, and yéeld him his realme, all excuſes ſet apart.</p>
                     <p>Meſſenger (aunſwered <hi>Iupiter</hi>) if I were ſuch one as ye ſay, with iuſt reaſon ye and other might giue ſentence and condemnation vpon mee: I were then guiltie for both parties: And I trow if <hi>Ganimedes</hi> (of whome ye haue ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken) had heard my my excuſe, hée would not bee mine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie. I aunſwere you, that I loue my father <hi>Saturne,</hi> in as much as hee is my father. But I ſay to you on the other part, that he hath oft tymes ſought to put me to death, hée ſhewing himſelfe my mortall aduerſarie and not father. (For euery father naturally loueth his ſonne) and for that regarde I will kéepe me from him, as from mine enemie: And will well that the <hi>Troyans</hi> knowe, that if they come and aſſayle mee, I will defende mee with all my puiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>With this aunſwere, returned the ſaide <hi>Troian</hi> vnto <hi>Saturne,</hi> and <hi>Ganimedes,</hi> and ſayd vnto them what he had found. <hi>Saturne</hi> and <hi>Ganimedes</hi> ſwore then the death of <hi>Iupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and approched ſo nigh the ſtrait, that they came within a bow ſhot, the one nigh vnto the other: and from as farre as they ſawe each one nigh vnto the other, they made great cryes and ſhowtes. <hi>Iupiter</hi> had ſet his puiſſaunce in two wings, whereof hee was chiefe in the formoſt, and <hi>Ixion,</hi> and his <hi>Centaures</hi> were gouernours of the ſecond. When <hi>Iupiter</hi> had ſéene that there was no way but for to ſkirmiſh, he ſaid he would begin the battaile: and after that he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged his people, he pricked his horſe foorth, and then happened and befell a maruaylous thing, For from the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:7118:66"/>
high clouds aboue, came downe an Eagle vpon his head, and after beganne to flie about him, making him ioy and théere, and departed not nor left him during the battaile.</p>
                     <p>By the flying of this Eagle, <hi>Iupiter</hi> and the people tooke in them an hope of good ſucceſſe. And <hi>Saturne</hi> and the <hi>Troi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> fell in a feare and doubt that could not come out of their conceits. What ſhall I ſay more? when <hi>Iupiter</hi> ſawe the dooing of the Eagle, he had a great ioy in his heart, and as a man well aſſured in his bodie, he entred among the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of the <hi>Troyans,</hi> that ſhot thicke at him, and running as a tempeſt, paſſed by their arrowes, and tarried not for reſiſtance of ſhot, till he came among the men of armes, of the <hi>Troyans.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Troyans</hi> had neuer ſéene man on horſe backe before, and when they ſaw <hi>Iupiter,</hi> they had thought it had béene halfe a man and halfe a horſe: and there were ſome that fled at his comming, and ſome abode and fought valliantly, againſt him: thus began the battaile of that day. They of <hi>Crete</hi> followed <hi>Iupiter</hi> with a great noyſe of Tabors, and clarions, and began to ſkirmiſh with the <hi>Troyans:</hi> they did their beſt on both ſides, <hi>Iupiter</hi> bare to the ground many <hi>Troyans,</hi> and well employed his horſe on which he rode. <hi>Ganimedes</hi> and <hi>Saturne,</hi> on the other ſide failed not. Alway <hi>Iupiter</hi> proued himſelfe in armes the moſt expert aboue all other. And abandoned his body and life vnto the fight of his enemies, and there was no man that durſt haue to do with him or abide him, but he was ſlain and put vnderfoote, by the cutting and ſmiting of his ſword.</p>
                     <p>Cruell and fierce was this battaile. The <hi>Troyans</hi> were without feare, and did great proweſſes, and manly by the the leading of <hi>Saturne,</hi> and of <hi>Ganimedes. Saturne</hi> met <hi>Iupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> often times, as he that ſought great ſtrokes: but <hi>Iupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> that knew him well, would neuer abide him, ſaying: that he would neuer ſet hand on his perſon, but eſchewed and fled his death vnto his power. This notwithſtanding hee ſought the death of his helpers, and made no ſparing,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:7118:67"/>
of their harneſſe, ne armor of leather, of their heades, ne of their liues, of yong, nor of old, of valiant, nor of hardy, it was to him all one: he yéelded neither to one ſide, nor to other, for ſtroke of ſword, of mace, ne of guiſarme. Yet he had oft re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the faire <hi>Danae:</hi> and deſiring to be quit of his enemies, for to go about her deliuerance, like as he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed vnto her, he ſmote off heads and arms. Vnto him was nothing impoſſible. At euery ſtroke he dyed his ſword with new blood, and the Eagle did flée alway about him, now low, now hie. Wherfore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                        <hi>Troians</hi> had great deſpite in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues.</p>

                        <hi>Ganimedes</hi> the noble <hi>Troyan</hi> was of little ſtature. Yet notwithſtanding, he was of more greater courage then any other, vigorouſlie he fought agaynſt them of <hi>Crete,</hi> as hee that mynded nothing but to get worſhippe and honour. What ſhall I ſay? they fought thus togither in this poynt, from the morning till the euening, without that any of both parties obtayned any winning or loſſe, and then <hi>Saturne</hi> withdrew his people on the one ſide, and <hi>Iupiter</hi> returned with the King <hi>Ixion</hi> and the <hi>Centaures,</hi> and ſtill followed him alwayes the Eagle, and ſate vppon his Tent, which was made of boughes, and greene ruſhes. For at that time Tents and Pauillions of cloath were not had nor vſed, howbéeit, the making of linnen cloath, and of cloath of Golde, and Silke was founde afore this tyme. In this night they of <hi>Troy,</hi> and they of <hi>Crete,</hi> made great cheare in theyr Tentes and lodgings: and diſpoſed them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne againe on the morrowe the labour of armes, hoping all to haue the better and victorie. The hurt men were dreſſed, and the harneſſe broken was made again and amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: they ſpake largely of the proweſſes of one and other, but principally they helde theyr ſpeaches of the Eagle, and ſpake ſo much of him, that <hi>Iupiter</hi> that ſame night tooke a péece of Crimſon Satten, containing a yard and a halfe ſquare, and made therein the reſemblaunce of an Eagle of Golde, and ſet it on a Speare, and made a banner, ſaying, that he would beare that banner in all battailes euer after.

And ſaid further that he vnderſtood by the Eagle, that it was a token to him, that he ſhould abide victorious of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. And that he ſhould be ſoueraigne king of <hi>Crete,</hi> like as the Eagle is king of all foules.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Vch were the ſpeaches of King <hi>Iupiter</hi> in this night, the which hee paſſed the moſt ioyouſly that he could: and he vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited the hurt men, and comforted them, and concluded with <hi>Ixion,</hi> that the day following the <hi>Centaures</hi> ſhoulde haue the battaile, and they that had fough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the day before ſhould reſt them. After this he ſlept on the gréene, and reſted him vntil the time that the <hi>Centaures</hi> put them in aray, and went to horſebacke. And ſo did <hi>Iupiter,</hi> for he had leuer haue died, then to haue béene idle. At this time <hi>Saturne</hi> ſlept not, nor was there no more ſlackneſſe found in him and <hi>Ganimedes,</hi> then was in <hi>Iupiter,</hi> for they were ſure that they ſhould be met withall, and aſſailed of their enemies againe. They doubted and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rayed them the beſt wiſe they could, and about the Sunne ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing they trained and went vnto the hoſt of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging each other, to ſmite and fight, and aſſaile their mortall enemies hardily, for to auenge the blood of their fellowes, that were dead in the battaile the day before.</p>
                     <p>For to make ſhort: then the <hi>Troians</hi> were ſore inflamed with appetite of vengeance, and were the firſt in the field, wherefore they had great ioy in their harts, &amp; made a right great cry. But this ioy was anon abated vnto them: for ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly as <hi>Iupiter</hi> &amp; the <hi>Centaures</hi> heard their cry, they took the baner with the Eagle of gold, their ſpears and their ſhields,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:7118:68"/>
and with a ioyous ſound of trumpets clarions and tabours, pricked forth their horſes which ran ſwiftly through the aire, and running as they that held not of heauen ne of earth, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theyr enemies they beganne to fight. Certes, when the <hi>Troyans</hi> ſawe the Centaures mounted on horſebacke, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning as the winde, they were ſo amaſed and affraide, that they had wéened, neuer to haue ſéene light day. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they tooke courage and abode them, and the Centaures fought ſo mightily among them, that eche one of them bare to the earth a <hi>Troyan</hi> with the point of his ſpeare. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other, <hi>Ganimedes</hi> was borne downe to the earth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g them: and ſome were hurt and ſome reléeued after hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and ſome without hurte. When <hi>Ganimedes</hi> felt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe among the horſe-féete, he was in his heart terrible an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, and ſaid that he would be ſhortly auenged. Anon he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe ſodainly and tooke his ſwoord, and ſéeing the Centaure that had ſmitten him down, doing meruailous feats of arms among a great many of his folke, that mightily withſtood his vnmeaſurable ſtrokes, he gaue vnto him ſo great a ſtroke, as he was leaning on the right ſide to haue ſmitten a <hi>Troyan,</hi> that he gaue him a great wound, by which he was ſo aſtony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he droue him down of his horſe, and he himſelfe leapt vp into the ſaddle. This Centaure was named <hi>Eſon,</hi> and was yong, and was afterward father of <hi>Iaſon</hi> that conquered the golden fléece. When he had receyued the ſtroke that <hi>Ganimedes</hi> had giuen him, he made a cry ſo great, that tenne Centaures came running, and defended him from the preaſe. And caſting downe one another, they beate the <hi>Troyans,</hi> and caſt them downe and ſparkeled their bloud that all the place was dyed red: and as they found <hi>Eſon</hi> and <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimedes</hi> the one nighe the other, and beholding <hi>Ganimedes</hi> that he practiſed to manage and gouerne his horſe: and ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theyr felow put down from his horſe, they were paſſingly ſurpriſed with great yre, and by mortall hate, they purſued <hi>Ganimedes</hi> vnto death.

caſting and ſmyting on <hi>Ganimedes:</hi> the <hi>Troyans</hi> did their vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to defend him, and put themſelues in ieopardy of death for him. For many of them were ſlaine and ſore hurt.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Centaures were ſtrong, huge, great and lothly: the <hi>Troyans</hi> had more courage then ſtrength of body. In this place <hi>Ganimedes</hi> ſhewed enough of proweſſe, and of valure and well defended him a while: but in the end Fortune was to him aduerſe, in ſuch wiſe, that after he had ſuffered many aſſaultes: and that he had ſéene put and caſt to grounde, mo then a thouſand <hi>Troyans,</hi> he behelde on the otherſide, and ſaw <hi>Saturne</hi> retyre in playne diſcomfiture.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Saturne</hi> then all deſpaired entred into his ſhip, with great loſſe of <hi>Troyans,</hi> and <hi>Ganimedes</hi> entred into an other, right angry and ſo diſpleaſant that I cannot rehearſe.

                     <p>My brethren, and my fellowes, fortune hath doon to vs a grace by which we be brought and conducted hither, but this grace is to vs little proffit as we may plainly conceyue. Lo heare is the King <hi>Iupiter,</hi> which hath doone to vs great ſhame, for to chaſe vs into our owne territorye: and what ſhame will it be to him that will now flie? and more ouer, who is he that nowe will not holde the brydle by the

téeth? now behoueth not to flie, but nowe it behoueth for to fight. It is méete and neceſſarie for to reuenge his loſſes and his bloud, and for to recouer worſhip.

And ſome there be that make them readie to welcome vs. And who that now is not well couragious, neuer fare he well: let euery man enforce the vertue of his ſtrength. For as for me, for to be hewen in péeces, I will no more flee: I pray you that ye take courage and abide with me.</p>
                     <p>Two things happened whiles he ſpake and vttered theſe ſpéeches vnto his people, the <hi>Troyans</hi> were aduertiſed of the coming of their men, and of the following and landing of their aduerſaries, and they diſpoſed them to reſiſt and withſtand them. And <hi>Iupiter</hi> and his men approched the port, and with that <hi>Ganimedes</hi> left warning his fellowes, and ran vnto the port, holding in his hand a ſtrong ſpeare, his companie tooke example by his right high courage, and followed him. Then began both the parties to make their cries, that went vp into the aire. <hi>Iupiter</hi> and his <hi>Centaures</hi> inforced them to take land. <hi>Ganimedes</hi> and the <hi>Troyans</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced them to defend and to put them from the land. Great and ſore ſtrokes were giuen: many of them were periſhed in the ſea. And many there were that their bloud was ſhed on the land. But <hi>Iupiter</hi> that had no fellow in the place, gat land in a little ſpace, and ſuſtained the fierceneſſe of the ſkirmiſh, by helpe of ſome of the <hi>Centaures,</hi> ſo that he made <hi>Ganimedes</hi> to retire backe to his fellowes, and ſo exployted by the hewing of his ſharpe ſword, that he made all his men to take land, and had lightly put <hi>Ganimedes</hi> and his men to the foyle, if out of <hi>Troy</hi> had not come the king <hi>Troos</hi> and <hi>Ilion,</hi> with a great multitude of people, that ranne vnto the reſkewe and helpe of the hardie and valiant <hi>Ganimedes,</hi> who for to ſaue his men, offered and put his

bodie to incredible trauell and labour.</p>
                     <p>The King <hi>Troos</hi> and <hi>Ilion,</hi> then made a ſallie out of <hi>Troy,</hi> in right fayre order, and expoſed them to beare a part in the trauaile of theyr blood. <hi>Iupiter</hi> with <hi>Ixion</hi> and the <hi>Centaures,</hi> left then them that he eſtéemed vanquiſhed and ouercome, and directed their forces againſt king <hi>Troos</hi> and <hi>Ilion,</hi> and them that followed them, notwithſtanding, that they had béene féebled by the ayre, and béeing on the ſea, which did them little good. The <hi>Centaures</hi> were great and huge, and ſtrong as oliphants, hardy as lions, and eager as Tigers. At this time the weather was fayre and cleare, the ſunne ſhone faire, when they began to ſkirmiſh: it was a fayre thing to ſée the bickerings, and a great noyſe to heare the cries: there was many a ſpeare broken, and many an arrow ſhot, and many a ſtaffe and guiſarme ſhiuered, helms inogh fruſhed, and many ſkins of Lions, Beares, &amp; Horſes, ſmitten and torne in péeces. <hi>Troos</hi> and <hi>Ilion</hi> were right aſper and fierce in the reſkew of <hi>Ganimedes. Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Ixion,</hi> were valiant and deſirous to get honour, and ſo fought and layde on the <hi>Troyans,</hi> on the right ſide, and on the left ſide, that before them was no reſiſtance, nor order holden, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The Banner of the Eagle of Golde was alway in the moſt ſtrength of the battaile. The King <hi>Troos</hi> that had neuer ſéene Banner vſed in battaile, was greatlie amaruayled what it ſhould ſignifie, and oft tymes did what hée could to fight agaynſt them that helde it, and woulde faine haue put it downe, and ſmitten it into péeces, but alway he found there ſo great ſtrokes, and ſo wel laid on, that hée was faine to go as farre backe as he came nigh. Hee was valiaunt of his bodie, and well knewe the Arte of warre. <hi>Iupiter</hi> approoued him many times and often, and fought with him in many places, and noted him in his minde for a notable man: there was in him no feare ne dreade, nor alſo in his ſonnes <hi>Ilion,</hi> and <hi>Gani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes:</hi> they yéelded vnto armes their deuoirs. They did

worſhipfully deale with their bodies, vnto their puiſſance without ende. They wrought and fought with their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, making their ſwords red in the bloud of the <hi>Creti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> They followed with great force, in ſuch wiſe, that they fought all that day, otherwile afore, and ſometime behinde. And it was ſo in the ende, that when the ſunne began to go downe, <hi>Ganimedes</hi> thinking on his great loſſe, and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to recouer his worſhip, tooke a terrible and mighty axe, and enflamed with right noble courage, fought about the baner of the Eagle of gold, where was the moſt ſtrength, and ſmote downe on the one ſide and other, ſo vnmeaſura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurably, that his axe changed colour, and he cried with an high voyce, <hi>Troy, Troy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Iupiter</hi> had alway an eye on the banner. When he heard the crie of <hi>Ganimedes,</hi> and ſaw his behauiour, he knew him, whereof he had great ioy, for he ſought no man but him: he gaue ouer the place where he was in, and ioyouſly adreſſed him vnto him and ſaide. O valiant <hi>Troyan,</hi> thou haſt ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thy proweſſe all the day, and now thou manifeſteſt and ſheweſt thy ſelfe by great feats of armes, and of great ſhouts. Thou art onely he that I ſéeke among the valiants of <hi>Troy:</hi> not onely that I preſume to be more valiant in armes then thou, but for as much as thou art he that haſt aſſailed <hi>Crete,</hi> and that I haue purſued thee hither. Thou haſt aſſailed and fought with me, army againſt armie, and nowe let vs fight body againſt body, and he take it that may get it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ganimedes</hi> with this word lifted vp his axe, and caſting his eyes on <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and thinking of that he had heard, made him this anſwere: Happie and fortunate king of <hi>Crete</hi> I know nowe that thou art worthy to haue grace of fortune, and that thou art more wiſe then ſtrong. Thou ſéeſt that fortune is with thée, neuertheleſſe now thou enhaunſeſt not thy ſelfe aboue me, I allow and prayſe thée: in as much as thou doſt worſhip and honour to thine enemie, and diſprai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt him not, but imagineſt that hee hath courage at his
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:7118:71"/>
heart, know thou that thou doſt thy ſelfe honour and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. For, to diſprayſe and blame another man, no man ought to aduance himſelfe. I would that it pleaſed the gods, that thy father <hi>Saturn</hi> which is wandering on the ſea, were now here, for it is mine intent that by his helpe we would haue reaſon of thée, and I will come thereto, if it be for me poſſible, for I ſhould be ſatiſfied for all my hurts and loſſes, if I might conquer and ouercome thée. And without mo words, <hi>Ganimedes</hi> let flie his axe, and ſmote on <hi>Iupiter. Iupiter</hi> couered him with his ſhield, which was ſmitten in two peeces by the cutting of the axe, and then <hi>Iupiter</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtirred himſelfe, who all that day had abſtained and ſpared from fight and the feats of armes: and commanded his folke that they ſhould let him alone with <hi>Ganimedes,</hi> for as much as he was alone. And nowe he defended himſelfe againſt the axe of <hi>Ganimedes,</hi> and be laboured him with his ſword, the moſt beſt wiſe that to him was poſſible.</p>
                     <p>Thus began the battaile of the two champions of <hi>Crede,</hi> and of <hi>Troy.</hi> They were both right expert, to do the feats of armes: their cries were high and fierce: they ſmote each other fiercely &amp; eagerly: the fire ſprang out of their helmes, by the might of their ſtrokes. But when fortune was on the part of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> what might <hi>Ganimedes</hi> do? His ſtrokes were great, and hee gaue vnto <hi>Ganimedes</hi> many wounds: and indéede tooke away his axe, by the meane of a great wound that he had in the right arme, &amp; might haue put him to death, if he would. But for to make ſhort proceſſe: when he had taken his weapon from him, he had pitie on him, and ſaued his life, and cauſed him to be kept by foure <hi>Centaure<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <head>CHAP. XXVII. ¶How the King Troos, and Ilion his ſon, made great ſorrow for Ganimedes for they wiſt not where he was becom, And how Iupiter went to the ſea, for to go to Argos</head>
                     <p>WHen <hi>Troos</hi> and <hi>Ilion</hi> were withdrawen, they abode at the gate vnto the time that all the <hi>Troyans</hi> were come againe into the Citie, as they that knew not where <hi>Ganimedes</hi> was become, whome they ſore deſired to haue found. All they that were in the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile of the <hi>Troyans,</hi> were entred, and there was no man that coulde tell the King <hi>Troos,</hi> where his ſonne <hi>Ganime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> was: or whether he was aliue or dead. And when hée ſawe, that he hadde no more men left in the fielde, he retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into his Pallace ſorrowing and greatlye vexed: and ſent for them that were come againe from <hi>Crete,</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of them of all the tydings, and what they hadde doone with his ſonne. As touching his ſonne they aunſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: that in the euening hée was in the preaſe among his enemyes, but they wiſt not what was become of him. And as touching the tydings of <hi>Crete,</hi> they tolde him, how they had ſpedde in theyr Iourney againſt them: and how the <hi>Eagle</hi> appeared vnto <hi>Iupiter:</hi> and how they were ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by the ſtrength of the centaures. And how they wiſt not where <hi>Saturne</hi> was become.</p>
                     <p>Theſe tydings gaue vnto the king <hi>Troos</hi> ſorrowe vppon ſorrowe, and to <hi>Ilion</hi> alſo. And the teares fell downe from theyr eyes: and in ſpeciall <hi>Ilion</hi> wept ſore, bewayling his brother in this manner: Alas my brother, alas <hi>Ganimedes,</hi> where is become the glorie of <hi>Troye,</hi> by the vnfortunate and vnhappy <hi>Saturne,</hi> which hath failed there in thy néede. At the leaſt if thou hadſt come againe, we togither would haue doon our beſt to haue bin aue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged of this loſſe. We would haue aſſayed our bodies, by fraternall loue, for to haue recouered thine honour. How is it, art thou periſhed by venturing?
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:7118:72"/>
what hard gréefe and ſorrowe is thée befallen? for to ſay all thy miſaduenture and miſhap is too preiudicial vnto the houſe of <hi>Troy. Ilion</hi> faire ſonne, anſwered <hi>Troos,</hi> for one aduerſitie it behoueth not to be abaſhed in the warre, in any wiſe, but to haue firme courage. War giueth this day victory to one, and on the morne, taketh it away, and giueth it to another, and ſo putteth each out. A vertuous and a manly ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto his death, ought not to be afraide. If <hi>Ganimedes</hi> he dead in the battaile, or if he be taken, what remedy? it is then expedient, eyther to auenge his death or to ſuccour him: but our enemyes be in little number, we will to morrow fight with them againe, and let the gods doo their willes of vs. And if I faile herein, I ſhall be quite diſcouraged.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ilion,</hi> and the nobles of <hi>Troy,</hi> comforted them with theſe words of king <hi>Troos,</hi> and confirmed his reſolution for to go on the morne, to aſſayle their enemies. Whileſt theſe things were in parle in the citie, <hi>Iupiter</hi> was in the fielde, and made great chéere, with <hi>Ixion,</hi> and the <hi>Centaures:</hi> and being ſet at ſupper vpon the ground, al about a great ſtone, <hi>Iupiter</hi> ſent for to fetch <hi>Ganimedes,</hi> and made him to ſup with them. <hi>Gani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes</hi> was ſore mooued, and had in his heart great trouble: yet he tooke a ſhort refection with them, for he felt right great ache and ſmarte in his woundes. And there <hi>Iupiter</hi> comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with him, ſaying, that he was the valianteſt man that euer was ſéene among the moſt valianteſt of <hi>Troy:</hi> and for as much as he was in his mercye, and that it was hée, that late with his father, deſcended into <hi>Crete,</hi> where he had gladly planted his name in worſhippe, if fortune woulde haue ſuffered him: therefore (ſayd he) I will no more warre before <hi>Troye:</hi> but I will enter agayne to morne into the Sea, and will go and putte in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, a thing that lyeth me nowe ſore at hearte: And will well that ye knowe, that I haue intencion to go vnto the Realme of <hi>Argos,</hi> vnto the Tower of <hi>Dardan,</hi> for to deliuer, according to my promiſe, out of the ſame Tower the fayre <hi>Danae,</hi> whome the King <hi>Acriſius</hi>
                        <pb n="128" facs="tcp:7118:73"/>
holdeth faſt ſhut in, without any reaſon. This concluſion pleaſed king <hi>Ixion,</hi> and the <hi>Centaures,</hi> for as much as they had heard ſpeake of the Tower of <hi>Dardain:</hi> and they thought well that the <hi>Argiens</hi> might not hold againſt their ſtrength. When that they had eaten, they entred into their ſhips, and thought among other things, on the wounds of them that were hurt, and alſo of <hi>Ganimedes.</hi> And after they laide them downe on the ſtraw to ſléepe, and about two houres before day they weighed anchor, and departed ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly, that the <hi>Troyans</hi> had no knowledge thereof. And on the morrow betimes, when king <hi>Troos</hi> and <hi>Ilion</hi> iſſued out of <hi>Troy</hi> to battaile, they ranged in good order, and found no man to haue to do withall, nor they could not ſée nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue their enemies on no coaſt of the ſea, for they had ſo farre ſailed from the port, that by that time they were out of ſight. Thus they had great ſorrow maruailouſly, and came vnto the place where the battaile had béene, and buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the dead men. But nowe I will leaue ſpeaking of them, and of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and will turne vnto the Hiſtory of <hi>Danae.</hi>

But certes, when euening was come of the day that he had ſet, and hee was not come, nor ſhe heard no tydings of him, when ſhe ſawe that hée came not, and that the fruit of her bellie appeared: ſhe went downe from the window of the hie Tower, and all ſurpriſed with diſpayre, to beholde her belly, ſayde: poore belly, I may no longer hide thée, I haue couered thée vnto this time, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the comming of <hi>Iupiter:</hi> the day is come and paſt that he ſhould haue come, and there is no tidings of him.

                     <p>In theſe and ſuch like wordes, <hi>Danae</hi> paſſed ouer this night, without ſléeping or reſt: from thenchforth ſhe began to be all melancholious, and tooke this ſo ſore to heart, that ſhe fell into a right grieuous maladie. When the maydens that nothing knew of this caſe, ſaw her ſo euill diſpoſed, they ſignifyed it into the king <hi>Acriſius.</hi> And then came the king to viſit his daughter, and betooke her to the cure of his Phiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians and cunning men, and demaunded of them what ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladie ſhe had. They anſwered him in the preſence of <hi>Danae,</hi> that ſhe was great with childe, and that in ſhort time ſhée ſhould be deliuered. <hi>Danae</hi> anſwered, that they fayled to ſay the truth, and that ſhe had neuer knowne man: and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied her fact as much as in her was poſſible, hoping alway to liue: for ſhe knewe well that her father would condemne her to death, if he knewe that ſhe were with child. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this, all the maydens of the houſe ſtriued with the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe, ſaying, that they had well and ſurely kept the tower, that no man ſaue the king had ſpoken to her, but if he were come inuiſible, ſince that they had receyued her into their gouernance. Whereat the king was greatly abaſhed, and ſore wondered.</p>
                     <p>When the king heard theſe wordes, and ſaw the ſtate of his daughter, he was ſore troubled. For by experience he ſawe well, and it appeared that <hi>Danae</hi> was with childe: hée truſted and beléeued better the Phiſitians, then the excuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the maydens, and of his daughter. And for to knowe the truth, he ſent all the maydens of the place into priſon to <hi>Argos,</hi> and betooke <hi>Danae</hi> in kéeping to other women, and commaunded them vpon paine of death, that they ſhould tell him, if ſhe were or happened to be deliuered of childe or no. Within a certaine tyme, when <hi>Danae</hi> ſawe her in this caſe, ſhée began to fall into wéeping. The king <hi>Acriſius,</hi> from this day forth, came euery day to knowe how ſhe did. She wept without ceaſing: ſhée ſpake not but vnto her heart: and ſhée bewayled her loue, and complayned on For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:7118:74"/>
ſorrowfully. But when ſhe had laboured long in theſe wéepings, and that her faire eyes were made great and red, about fiftéene dayes before the time of her childing, the beganne to remember the cauſe why ſhe was put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Tower. And that the gods had prognoſticated, that ſhe ſhould haue a ſonne that ſhould bée king of <hi>Argos.</hi> In this remembrance ſhe was comforted a little: and when the time came that nine months was expired, ſhe brought forth a paſſing faire ſonne, which the Ladyes and women re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued and named him <hi>Perſeus:</hi> And after that ſignified it vnto the king. But at the birth of this childe, ſhe excuſed and put out of blame all the damoſels, and ſaide that they were all innocents of her fact.</p>
                     <p>Anon then as the king <hi>Acriſius</hi> knew the veritie of his Daughter, and that ſhe had a faire ſonne, he had in his heart more of ſorrow then of ioy, and condemned her to death indéede, and commanded two of his mariners, that they ſhould take the mother and her childe, and put them in a little Boate, them both alone, and that they ſhould carrie them farre into the high ſea, that after ſhould neuer man ſée them nor haue knowledge of them. The ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners durſt not refuſe the commaundement of the King: but by his commandement, they went vnto the Tower <hi>Dardane,</hi> and tooke <hi>Danae,</hi> and her ſonne <hi>Perſeus,</hi> and ſaid vnto the damoſell al that that they had charge to do, praying her humbly that ſhee would pardon them. And this was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout midnight, when <hi>Danae</hi> vnderſtood that ſhee ſhould bée caſt into the ſea, and her ſonne with her. Yet ſhe had hope to eſcape this perill, by the meane of the fortune of her ſon. This notwithſtanding, the teares ran downe from her eyes, and wéeping tenderly, ſhe tooke her leaue of the ladies and damoſels that had her in kéeping: and they let her be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried vpon the ſea, making complaint &amp; pitious bewailings.</p>
                     <p>When the mariners had brought hir vpon the ſea, they left her in a litle boat, &amp; put in her lap <hi>Perſeus</hi> her faire ſon. And as haſtily as they might they conducted her into the déepe ſea
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:7118:75"/>
without meate or drinke, and without ſterne or gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naile, and gaue her ouer to all windes. Then was there many a teare wept among the mariners, and <hi>Danae,</hi> and <hi>Perſeus</hi> the young childe. The marriners bewailed with great compaſſion that they had to ſée ſuch a Damoſell aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned to perill of death. <hi>Danae</hi> wept in conſidering the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of her father, and the fault that <hi>Iupiter</hi> had done to her, and alſo for the perill which ſhe might not reſiſt: and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeus</hi> wept for the blowing of the winde, and for the groſſe ayre of the ſea, that his tenderneſſe might not well ſuffer to endure. In this faſhion the Matrones returned to <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gos,</hi> and the right diſcomforted Damoſell <hi>Danae</hi> went forth vpon the waues of the ſea, at the agréement and will of the windes. The waues were right fearefull, and lifted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues into the ayre as Mountaynes, the windes blewe by great ſtormes, the little Boate was borne and caſt vpon the waues, and oftentymes <hi>Danae</hi> looked, and ſuppoſed to haue periſhed: but ſhée had alway hope in Fortune. And ſo well it happened, that in this aduerſitie and trouble, ſhée was caſt into the Sea of <hi>Apulia</hi> or <hi>Naples.</hi> And there ſhée was found by aduenture of a Fiſher, that for pitie and charitie tooke her into his Shippe, and her ſonne, and brought her on lande, foraſmuch as hee ſawe it was great néede.</p>
                     <p>At this time the noble <hi>Danae</hi> was as a deade bodie, and halfe gone: when the marriner had brought her a land, the tooke a ring of gold that ſhe ware on her finger, and gaue it vnto the good man, praying him, that he would bring her into ſome houſe, where ſhee might warme and cheriſh her, with her childe, for he was nigh dead for colde, and was all in a traunce. The marriner tooke the Golde Ring, and brought the Damoſell, and the little childe into his houſe, and made them a good fire, and brought them meate and drinke. As ſoone as <hi>Perſeus</hi> felt the ayre of the fyre, his heart came to him againe, and he began to laugh on his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. When ſhee ſawe that, all her ſorrowes turned to
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:7118:75"/>
nought, and ſhe tooke hope of good fortune. She then made ready and arayed her ſon, and her colour came againe: &amp; ſhe did eate, and drinke. What ſhall I ſay? the fiſher behelde her, and then ſéeing in her ſo much beautie, that the like to her he ſawe neuer none, he went vnto the court of the king of <hi>Naples,</hi> and tolde him his aduenture, prayſing ſo certaynly her beautie, that the King ſent haſtely for to fetch her. This King was named <hi>Pilonus,</hi> and was ſonne to the auncient <hi>Iupiter.</hi> And when <hi>Danae</hi> was come before him, ſodaynlye he waxed amorous of her, and demaunded her name, her countrey, and the cauſe why ſhe was aduentured on the ſea. At beginning ſhe excuſed her ſelfe of al theſe things, vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to tell all, and began to wéepe. When the King ſawe that, he comforted her and ſaid to her, that he would take her to his wife, for her beautie: and ſpake ſo fayre to her, and ſo graciouſly, that ſhe tolde him al her life, how ſhe was daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the king <hi>Acriſius,</hi> and how ſhe was ſhutte in the tower, and how <hi>Iupiter</hi> had deceyued her, and how her father hadde put her in the ſea. What ſhall I ſay more? when the King <hi>Pilonus</hi> heard all theſe fortunes of the damoſell, he had pitie on her, and wedded her with great honour, and did put to nurſe <hi>Perſeus,</hi> and gat on her a ſonne, which was named <hi>Danaus:</hi> but of this matter I will ceaſe, and turne again to the hiſtory of <hi>Iupiter.</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen <hi>Iupiter</hi> was departed from <hi>Troy,</hi> as afore is ſaid, he made his mariners to ſaile and row with all diligence, for to withdraw from the port, and for to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch <hi>Crete,</hi> for he knew well that the time of his promiſe made to <hi>Danae</hi> was expired, and that diſpleaſed him greatly, that he might not ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it. His mariners did all that they could do by the ſpace of a day naturall, but the day being paſt, there roſe a tempeſt in the ſea, ſo terrible and out of meaſure, that it bare many ſhips with their furniture vnder water, brake their ſternes and helmes, and drowned all the ſhips, ſauing onely that ſhip where <hi>Iupiter</hi> was in: wherefore he wept outragiouſly. The tempeſt dured two dayes and two nights. They ſaw not that time in the hauen, ſunne nor moone nor ſtarres. <hi>Iupiter</hi> and they that were with him thought neuer to haue died other death, yet they eſcaped the death, and tooke land on the third day when the tempeſt was ceaſed, not in <hi>Crete,</hi> nor in the ſea of <hi>Europe,</hi> but in the <hi>Ocean</hi> ſo far, that they knew not the language of them that inhabited the port where they came to ancre.</p>

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:7118:76"/>
touching this matter, and more then I can ſay: and alſo complained for his men that he had loſt in the ſtorme and tempeſt, as well as he complained for the default of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. But when his companions, that is to wit, <hi>Ixion,</hi> and the <hi>Centaures,</hi> and <hi>Ganimedes,</hi> had refreſhed them, and vit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed them, and had well put all things in point, and had taken all things neceſſarie for their ſhip, they weighed an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor, and departed from the port, &amp; tooke their way into the Eaſt: and ſo laboured day by day, and moneth vpon moneth, that they entred into the ſea <hi>Egee.</hi> And they had not long ſailed, when <hi>Egeon</hi> the great theefe and rouer, which held at his will all this ſea: then they diſankred from the port of the Ile of <hi>Deſert,</hi> and accompanied with ſixe gallies, and with a thouſand men of armes, came before <hi>Iupiter,</hi> proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them to battaile, in purpoſe to haue deſtroyed them.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Iupiter</hi> and the <hi>Centaures</hi> ſaw the behauiour of the théefe, they knew ſtraightway that they might not faile of battel, &amp; ſaying each to other they would defend themſelues vnto the death: they had not long held parliament among them, but they furniſhed them with their armes, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played the banner with the Eagle of gold. And in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playing, they made a great ioy, as they had beene in para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe. At this time had <hi>Ganimedes</hi> his wounds healed. When he ſaw that each man prepared him to fight, ſauing hee, which was priſoner, hee came and knéeled downe on his knées before <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and required him right humbly, that he would commaund to deliuer him his harneſſe, for to help to maintaine his worſhip, and alſo to defend his life, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing to do his true deuoir. <hi>Iupiter</hi> tooke vp <hi>Ganimedes,</hi> when hée ſaw him ſubmit himſelfe, and began to ſet his loue on him, in ſuch wiſe, that it endured vnto the death: and that more is, he made that his harneſſe and armes were yéelded to him, ſaying, that from thenceforth they would be brethren and fellowes in armes. And <hi>Ganimedes</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered to him, that he would alway abide and dwell his ſeruant.</p>

Théefe and rouer and pyrate, how dareſt thou purſue to death him that made thée tremble, and flie before him at the battaile of <hi>Crete,</hi> by ſéeing of his ſword dyed and made red with the bloud of the vnhappye <hi>Tytanoys?</hi> Beholde and ſee mee, I am <hi>Iupiter</hi> the mortall enemy of all thy linage.

It maye be well ſayde, that we ſhall run each vpon other, by great force: and that this conflict ſhal be right damageable for thée or for mée, and let the goddes doo their pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Egeon</hi> vnderſtoode what <hi>Iupiter</hi> had ſayde to him, and that he was the deſtroyer of his linage, he had his heart ſo incenſed with yre and impacience, that he could not anſwer one word: And grenning with his téeth, he began to ſmyte ſo hard toward <hi>Iupiter,</hi> that if the ſtroke of the axe, that he ſmit had bin right, there had neuer bin remedy of his life. But <hi>Iupiter</hi> knew the feates of war, and when he ſaw the ſtroke come, he auoyded it: and lifted vp his ſword, and charged it vpon <hi>Egeon</hi> ſo ſurely, that he could not auoide the ſtroke, which was ſo forcible, that he was ſo aſtonied as it made him fall downe vpon the plankes of the galley. Then made the pyrates and théeues a greate crye, and fell vpon <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and his fellowes. <hi>Ganimedes</hi> helde his axe in his handes, and was not then ydle: he fought and wrought valyantlye, after his power, and ſo did the <hi>Centaures.</hi> The ſkirmiſhe was great, and many were deade, not of the partye, of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> but of the partye of the pyrates, and then laboured the <hi>Centaures,</hi> ſo that they dyed theyr galleyes with the bloud of theyr ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: And that the pyrates, albeit they were tenne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſte one, coulde not, nor might not abyde before them. &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="137" facs="tcp:7118:77"/>Thus began the mortall battaile of the pyrates, and of the <hi>Centaures,</hi> when the one Galley had fought as long as they might, an other came on. This <hi>Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Ganimedes</hi> had inough to do to fight and they fayled not what to do, for the more they ſmote, the more diſpleaſure had the pyrates. Each of their ſtrokes was the death of a pyrate. In proceſſe of time <hi>Egeon</hi> came againe into the preaſe diſmayed, and fulfilled with impatience, he put himſelfe forth to fight, in the moſt ſtrength, all deſperately, to winne all, or to looſe all. At this time the battaile was ſo terrible and ſo deadly, that al the Gallies cloſed the Ship of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and ſmote on it: but this was to their miſhap and ilfare, for the moſt part of them were ſlaine: and then <hi>Ganimedes</hi> and <hi>Iupiter</hi> entered into the galley of king <hi>Egeon,</hi> where he fought ſo ſore, on the one ſide and the other, for enuie who ſhould do beſt, that of all them that were within, there was not left one man, but he was ſlaine, or caſt into the ſea, excepting onely <hi>Egeon,</hi> which <hi>Iupiter</hi> tooke with his hands, and bound him with an hundred chaines of yron, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>With theſe chaines of yron <hi>Egeon</hi> had a cuſtome for to bind his priſoners, vntill the time they had done his will. When the pyrats ſawe the miſchiefe that came vpon them, and that their maiſter was ouercome and bound with the chaines that he was woont to torment the priſoners withal, they intended to ſaue themſelues, and withdrew them from the ſhip of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> ſaying, that thoſe that they had fought withall, were no men but diuels: and that they were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happie that came vnto their hands. <hi>Iupiter</hi> had but one ſhip, The pyrates diſperſed abroad one here, another there. And when the <hi>Centaures</hi> ſawe that, they ſayde to <hi>Iupiter,</hi> that it ought to ſuffice to haue this victory ouer his enemy, and that it was no néede to make purſuit after the vnhappie théeues. <hi>Iupiter</hi> accorded to the ſame, and entred againe into his ſhip with <hi>Ganimedes</hi> and <hi>Egeon,</hi> and after made his mariners to take their courſe againe. And alway he had in his memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie <hi>Danae.</hi> It néedeth not to make long talke of theſe trauels
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:7118:78"/>
and iourneyes, and other aduentures. Hée was a yeare long ſayling by the ſea: and in the ende of the yeare, he arriued in his Realme, and there found foure hundred horſes, which they of <hi>Crete</hi> preſented him to his wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.</p>
                     <p>The Quéene <hi>Iuno</hi> his wife, made great chéere, for ſhée loued him with all her heart, wherefore ſhee feaſted him, and them that preſented to him the horſes. And hee put in priſon <hi>Egeon,</hi> and let <hi>Ganimedes</hi> go frée where hee would: they loued then together euer after as two brethren. When <hi>Iupiter</hi> had beene there thrée dayes, hée tooke foure hundred of his men of the moſt puiſſant, and made them Gentlemen, and after made them Knights, giuing to each of them one of his Horſes: and taught them, and infourmed them the feates of armes, after the diſcipline of <hi>Ixion</hi> and the <hi>Centaures.</hi> And when they had doone this, hee aſſembled a thouſand Pietons, or foote men, and two hundred Archers, and with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie of them and of the <hi>Centaures,</hi> and of the Knights, hée departed from <hi>Crete</hi> fiftéene dayes after his returne: and ſent not for <hi>Pluto,</hi> nor for <hi>Neptune,</hi> and tooke his way vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Cittie of <hi>Argos,</hi> meaning to haue taken away the fayre <hi>Danae.</hi> But he had not farre gone, when he encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and met one of the Citizens of <hi>Argos,</hi> a gentleman and worſhipfull, that recounted and tolde to him all the life of <hi>Danae,</hi> for as much as hee demanded of him tidings. And aſſured him on his life, that the king <hi>Acriſius</hi> had ſet her on the ſea, for as much as ſhe had brought forth a little ſonne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his commandement.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Iupiter</hi> heard the caſe and the miſfortune of <hi>Danae,</hi> he began to ſorrow and ſigh ſore: the ſweate came into his face, and teares into his eyes, he called <hi>Ganimedes</hi> and <hi>Ixion,</hi> and tolde them, that his voyage was broken; and that the king <hi>Acriſius</hi> had caſt her into the ſea, for whom he made this armie. <hi>Ganimedes</hi> and <hi>Ixion</hi> comforted him the beſt wiſe they could, &amp; brought him again to <hi>Crete:</hi>
                        <pb n="139" facs="tcp:7118:78"/>
he helde him there ſolitarily a whyle: and lay by his wife <hi>Iuno,</hi> and <hi>Iuno</hi> and her Aunt <hi>Ceres</hi> made him good chéere of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes. And ſo oft came <hi>Seres,</hi> that once ſhe aſked the cauſe of his ſorrowe. He behelde the beautie of her: &amp; for that ſhe was alone, he vſed the matter ſo that he had to doo with her, and knewe her fleſhly, and that ſhe conceiued of his ſéede a daughter: and after he determined in his minde, that he would go into <hi>Sicill,</hi> and conquer the countrey, delighting alwaye to occupie himſelfe in feates of armes: and taking leaue of the King <hi>Ixion,</hi> and of the <hi>Centaures,</hi> his ſhipping was made ready, and he went to the ſea, and came into <hi>Sicill,</hi> and conquered it vnto the Ile of <hi>Lemnos.</hi> And when he had ſo doone he went into <hi>Italy,</hi> and came into the houſe of King <hi>Ianus,</hi> which receyued him, and made him great chéere, and tolde him that his father <hi>Saturne</hi> was come newly for to dwel there by, and that he was ſingularly loued of al the people, for as much as he taught them to labour the vines and to ſow corne.</p>
                     <p>Al the bloud chaunged in <hi>Iupiter,</hi> when he hearde that <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> ſpake to him of his father <hi>Saturne:</hi> neuertheleſſe he went for to ſée him, and ſawe him, and founde his Father making and founding a newe Cittie in the place where now ſtand the <hi>Capitoll</hi> of <hi>Roome.</hi> And in ſuch wiſe hée ſubmitted him to his Father, that <hi>Saturne</hi> tooke him to his grace, and made peace with him: and alſo accorded to him that he ſhoulde enioy from thenceforth his realme of <hi>Crete.</hi> At the accord and making of this peace, were the King <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> and the King <hi>Euander,</hi> and they dwelled the one nighe the other, that is to wete, <hi>Ianus</hi> in a Cittie called <hi>Laurence,</hi> and <hi>Euander</hi> in a Cittie being nigh the mounte <hi>Auentin:</hi> and ſo was there the king <hi>Italus</hi> of <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> that made in this time a newe Cittie named <hi>Albe,</hi> vpon the riuer of <hi>Tybre.</hi> All theſe kings made great chéere for the agréement of the father and the ſonne. And thus <hi>Iupiter</hi> abiding there, he acquainted himſelf with the wife of king <hi>Euander,</hi> named <hi>Nicoſtrate,</hi> for aſmuch as ſhe was right expert in the ſcience

of nigromancie, and in charmes and ſorceries: And of hir he learned this ſcience. <hi>Iupiter</hi> after this, tooke leaue of her, and of his father <hi>Saturne,</hi> and of his neighbours, and left there <hi>Saturne,</hi> that was married againe vnto a woman cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Philiris,</hi> by whom he had a ſonne called <hi>Picus,</hi> that was father of king <hi>Famus,</hi> huſband of the quéene <hi>Fatua,</hi> of whom <hi>Hercules</hi> was amorous (as it ſhal be ſaid in the ſecond booke) and returned into <hi>Crete,</hi> and there found that his wife was deliuered of his ſonne <hi>Vulcan,</hi> and that his beloued Aunt <hi>Seres</hi> was deliuered of a daughter, named <hi>Proſerpina.</hi> Wherof <hi>Iuno</hi> was right euill pleaſed and content, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained to <hi>Iupiter</hi> of the diſhonour that he had done to her. But <hi>Iupiter</hi> ſet nought thereby, but laughed, and was more ioyous of his daughter then of his ſonne: For his daughter was maruailous faire, and <hi>Vulcan</hi> his ſonne was foule and crooke-backed.

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this time when <hi>Iupiter</hi> dwelled peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably king of <hi>Crete,</hi> and that his ſonne <hi>Vulcan</hi> waxed great, and learned the craft of Nigromancie, in the land of <hi>Heſperye</hi> there paſſed out of the world a king named <hi>Porcus,</hi> a man of right great valour, which the <hi>Heſperiens</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led god of the ſea of <hi>Spaine,</hi> anciently named <hi>Heſperie,</hi> as is ſaid. This king left thrée daughters that had not but one eye, as the Poets ſay: that is to ſay, their principall care was for the vanities of the worlde, and therefore they were called <hi>Gorgons,</hi> that is to ſay, ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or louers of the earth, for as much as they intended vnto vices, that hold of earthly things. Of theſe daughters, one was named <hi>Meduſa,</hi> the other <hi>Euriale,</hi> and the third <hi>Senno. Meduſa,</hi> that was the eldeſt of all the other, ſuccéeded in the Empire and in the Realme.

And landing on a day at the port of <hi>Athens,</hi> ſhee ſent vnto king <hi>Neptune,</hi> to require him that he would grant vnto her, that ſhe might enter into his Citie, for to worſhip in the temple of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe <hi>Pallas,</hi> which was newly made. <hi>Neptune</hi> did great honour vnto the Meſſengers of <hi>Meduſa,</hi> and accorded vnto her, that ſhee ſhould enter into his Citie, and into the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:7118:80"/>
Temple, vpon condition that ſhe ſhould haue none with her ſaue her damoſels. Whan <hi>Meduſa</hi> heard the aunſwere of king <hi>Neptune,</hi> ſhe concluded that ſhée would go into the temple: where of was a great talke. And ſhe was accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with many Damoſels ſo richly arayed, that it was a gallant ſight for to ſée. She entred into the Temple and into the citie, and there ſhe turned into ſtones, not onely the men that beheld her, but alſo the women, and among all other e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially a Quéene that was named <hi>Ida.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By this it is to be vnderſtood, that this <hi>Meduſa</hi> was of ſo excellent beautie, and was ſo paſſing rich, that all they that beheld her, gaue themſelues ouer wholly to couet her beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and her riches. And therefore write the poets, that they were turned into ſtones: For, they that diſpoſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues and giue them to the delightes of this worlde, be lykened and compared vnto harde ſtones, whereof maye no good come. Thus then <hi>Meduſa</hi> entring into <hi>Athens,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted and turned manye men into ſtones: in ſo much that <hi>Neptunus</hi> heard theſe tydings, and deſiring to ſée thys Quéene, hée went into the Temple where ſhée was in contemplation. And hée hadde not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>helde her, when hée felte himſelfe ſo deſirous of her, and of her loue, that hée ſayde to himſelfe, that ſhée ſhoulde be his wife, and that ſhée ſhoulde neuer eſcape him.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Meduſa</hi> was long ſpace in contemplation, during which <hi>Neptune</hi> deſired her beautie more and more, and his heart gaue him, that he ſhould obtaine his purpoſe. And anon after that his heart had thus chéered him, he a little pauſed, conſidering the excellencie of her griefe and thought trauerſed and aroſe in his minde, that conſtrayned him to ſay theſe wordes that follow: Alas, in what matter, in what ſorrowe, and in what right great and enflaming payne be they that be burning in loue by long ſpace of time, that I alreadye beginne to finde mée in ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye ſighes and paynes, that I wot not howe I maye in

time come vnto this Ladye, for to require her to be my wife She is ſhining in all beautie, and in right aboundaunt ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. This is it that I lacke. She beholdeth me otherwhiles in her prayers: it maye happen ſo well, that loue may turne her heart, for to make aliance betwixt her and me. And what is this? men ſay that loue hurteth no man, but if it be by his eyes. If the eyes be not made for to ſée, I will ſaye that my deſire ſhall hap well. Where am I? where I am: put me out. Where is my hart? where is my deſire? I know not what I thinke: my thought may be abuſed, and my a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe may well be reuerſed: myne eyes peraduenture thinke they ſee that they ſée not. Mine eares imagine to heare, and yet they be deafe. I finde my ſelfe in a great perplexity and very ataynder: and yet more, in a ſuperfluous errour, more then any man may haue. For, when I ſée this Ladye more excellent then all other in beautie and riches, reaſon telleth me, that ſhe is not come hither for me: and when I behold, that ſhée is alone without men in my Cittie, who ſhall againe ſaye my will? I will require her to be my wife, after that ſhe hath doone her deuotion: and if ſhée accord to my requeſt, my labour ſhall doo well. And if ſhe gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay, and withſtand it, then I muſt vſe force and authoritye royall.</p>

                        </hi> aroſe from her contemplation, and looked right fayre. <hi>Nep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune</hi> went to her, and did her reuerence, and after prayd her, that ſhe would go to his royall pallace for to refreſh her. <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſa</hi> thanked him of his curteſie, and ſayde, that ſhe might not well tarye there at that time. When <hi>Neptune</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtoode that ſhe was to returne, without ſtaying longer in his houſe nor in his Cittie: hée was ſore diſpleaſed in his heart, yet hée helde her in parle, and drewe her a parte, and ſayde vnto her (chaunging coloure) Madame, I am ſorye that ye refuſe to take harbor in my houſe. I am king of this Cittie, the goddes haue not giuen to mée ſo great happe, that I haue yet any wife, any Lady
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:7118:81"/>
or damoſel: it is ſo now happened, that the gods and fortune haue enſpired you to come hither. Certes, it is ſo that your right high beautie hath prepared the eye of my heart, and hath made me ſo deſirous of you, that I giue vnto you heart, body, and goods, and all that a louer may giue vnto his loue and Ladie, or any king may giue. Wherefore I pray you, that ye will go vnto my pallace, to the end that I may haue communication more ſecretly there, and tell you of the right great loue that I haue to you.</p>
                     <p>Anon, as <hi>Meduſa</hi> vnderſtood the requeſts of the king, ſhee began to frowne, and not willing to bee otherwiſe intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſhe anſwered to him. Syr king, if it were ſo that mine heart deſired acquaintance and communication with one man more then with another, in truth, if I ſo found me di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſed, I would holde my ſelfe right happie, finding my ſelfe in the grace of your eyes: but the matter goeth with me far otherwiſe, I loue men, as much one as another. I haue a purpoſe to abide and continue in my virginity. Ye be a king: you haue giuen to me ſafe conduct for to performe my pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage. I deſire you that ye holde you content, and that ye beare your ſelfe in ſuch wiſe, as if yee had neuer ſeene me. Madame (ſaide <hi>Neptune</hi>) how ſhall I do that ye ſay, when my heart is all giuen vnto you? Sir (anſwered <hi>Meduſa</hi>) it behoueth firſt to know, and after that to loue. I haue tolde you here that I haue a purpoſe to abide a virgine, what may it profit you to ſay, that ye haue giuen me your heart? theſe be but loſt words. Dame (ſaide <hi>Neptune</hi>) the Diamond ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, not till it be poliſhed: ye were neuer peraduenture de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired nor requeſted of loue before now: wherefore ye haue no more loue to one man then to another. Therefore yée muſt vnderſtand, that acquaintance bréedeth loue: and if ye will come and abide with me, I make no doubts but that your minde will change, and that ye will make a league with me. Sir (anſwered <hi>Meduſa</hi>) my will is vnchangeable. Notwithſtanding (ſaide <hi>Neptune</hi>) it muſt change, be not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſhed. Sir (anſwered <hi>Meduſa</hi>) I ſée nothing that giueth
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:7118:81"/>
me cauſe of abaſhment: for I féele my heart firme and ſtable in his operations. Ye be a King, and haue giuen me ſafe conduct, for to finiſhe my deuotion at the Temple of the goddeſſe of your Cittie. Reaſon and honour ſhould gouerne your courage. Dame (ſayd <hi>Neptune</hi>) if your beautie ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted not the beautie of other women, I would conſent anon to your returne: But when I conceyue in my minde you formed in ſo high a degrée of nature, that nothing lack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in you. And further, when I ſée that the great goddeſſe <hi>Pallas</hi> hath enſpyred you to come to this my Cittie, reaſon maye haue no place: howſoeuer it be by loue or by force, ye ſhal be my wife: for I had leuer die, and run into al the diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of the world, then for to fayle to haue your loue.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Meduſa</hi> that was wiſe had vnderſtood the wordes of <hi>Neptune,</hi> and ſawe well that he was couragiouſly infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with her amorous deſire, and that ſhe might not eſcape his power, for her beautie, vnleſſe it were by an aduenture: then ſhe chaunged her haire into colours: that is to ſaye, that where force reygned, ſhée wrought by ſubtiltie, and ſayde vnto the King. Syr, I knowe that ye be a great and puiſſante Lorde, and that loue hath mooued you by force to take me to your wife. Since your pleaſure is ſuch, I am content to do all what ſhall pleaſe you in ſuch wiſe as ye haue demaunded, and that this ſame daye be made the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage betwéene you and me: but, the more ſolemnly to halow the feaſte of our wedding, I requyre you of two things: Firſt, that I maye returne vnto the porte, to my people, for to araye and dreſſe me with my coſtly Iewels, for I maye not employe them to more great glorie then to vſe this daye of my mariage: And ſecondly, that ye will cauſe to araye and adreſſe the ladyes of this citie, for to receiue me as it appertayneth: for I will that ye well knowe, that in all the remnant of ladyes of the world, ye ſhal not find any that haue more moueable goodes nor riches then I haue.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Neptune</hi> was then as one al rauiſhed in ioy, when he heard this anſwer of <hi>Meduſa:</hi> he thanked her for her ſwéete words,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:7118:82"/>
and agréed to her, to do in ſuch wiſe as ſhe had deuiſed. And anon he ſent againe this <hi>Meduſa</hi> vnto the gallies, hoping that ſhe would returne againe to be his wife: but when ſhe, by the ſubtiltie of her wit, was deliuered againe at the port where <hi>Neptune</hi> had nothing to do: in ſtead for to returne to the citie, ſhe cauſed to weigh ancres of al her ſhips, and hoiſt ſaile, and in all haſte withdrew them from the port: and in ſtead to array her inveſtments nuptiall, ſhe tooke her arms, and made all her men to arme them. And thus ſhe eſcaped from <hi>Neptune,</hi> who was in great ſorrow maruailouſly, and in great anger ſaide, that ſhe had the head of a ſerpent, and that her haires were turned into colours, to the end to hide more graciouſly the malice of her heart: he repeated the maner how ſhe had deceiued and beguiled him, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Thus then eſcaped <hi>Meduſa</hi> the hands of <hi>Neptune,</hi> by the meane of her head ſerpentine: &amp; <hi>Neptune</hi> abode conuerted and turned into a ſtone: that is to ſay, hauing his minde ſet on earthly affections, and on the riches of <hi>Meduſa,</hi> and went not after her, for as much as her power of men, ſurmoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted much all the power of <hi>Athens.</hi> Of this thing ranne the renowme through all <hi>Greece.</hi> And the beautie of <hi>Meduſa</hi> was ſo commended, that from thoſe parts, went euery day many knights to ſée her, and many of them were turned into ſtones, and many loſt their treaſours: innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable enforcing themſelues by armes to conquer this Lady, who withſtood alway their aſſaults and indeuours, and alway abode conquerour of them.</p>

conſtraining them to pay her yearly large tributes. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by her eſtate and name aroſe, and was ſo great, that the fame thereof ran into many farre regions: and among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Citie of <hi>Naples,</hi> where reigned the king <hi>Pilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> as afore is ſayd.</p>
                     <p>In the time that the renowne of <hi>Meduſa</hi> was in this credite, <hi>Perſeus</hi> ſonne of <hi>Danae</hi> and <hi>Iupiter</hi> was in the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and prime of his ſtrength: and hee dayly required his mother and the king, that they would giue him leaue to ſéek his aduenture. When then <hi>Pilonus</hi> heard ſpeake of the mightineſſe of <hi>Meduſa,</hi> of her rapines, and of her auarice, he thought that his ſonne in lawe ſhould do a vertuous worke, if hée might correct her: ſo he told to <hi>Perſeus</hi> that he would ſend him thither. <hi>Perſeus</hi> thanked him, and ſayde, hée woulde employ thereto all his puiſſaunce. Then the king <hi>Pilonus</hi> ſent for men of Armes, and made readie thirtie Gallyes for the armie of <hi>Perſeus,</hi> and dubbed him knight, for the order of chiualrie began that time to be vſed in all the world. And it was decréed that that ſame day <hi>Perſeus</hi> ſhould go to the ſea.</p>
                     <p>And when the king had accompliſhed all the ceremonie to the caſe requyred in the Painims wiſe, <hi>Perſeus</hi> tooke leaue of the King <hi>Pilonus,</hi> and of his mother <hi>Danae,</hi> and of the damoſels, and right ioyouſly entred into his Galley: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward they weighed ancres, and departed from the port of <hi>Naples,</hi> with a great noyſe of Tabors and Trumpets, and with banner diſplayed, and ſayled into the déepe ſea. It was a good and faire ſight to ſée his departing. There was many a teare wept: euerie bodie loues <hi>Perſeus,</hi> for ſo much as hée was humble and courteous. The <hi>Apuliens</hi> departed neuer as long as they might ſée him: and then after they returned home, praying vnto the goddes, that good and right happie might be the fortune of <hi>Perſeus.</hi> And the noble knight went by the ſea, and the coaſts at all aduenture. What ſhall I ſay? he ſo haſted on his way that he came to <hi>Affricke,</hi> that was named <hi>Libie</hi> at that time, and there would haue refreſhed

But this King putte him from landing at this porte, and came in armes againſt him, and ſhewed by ſigne a farre off, that he would kéepe his countrey with his ſword. Then <hi>Perſeus,</hi> which woulde not there employe his armye, withdrewe him from the porte meaning to auenge him an other time, of that hard vſage, if fortune would helpe him. He paſſed the ſtrayte, and ſought ſo long the Realme of <hi>Meduſa,</hi> that anon after he found it, and had tydings by certain merchants that he found trauailing on the Sea, who tolde him that ſhe and her ſiſters ſoiourned in a citie which ſtoode on the ſea coaſt</p>
                     <p>Great was the ioye of <hi>Perſeus,</hi> when he vnderſtoode theſe tydings: his folke had great nede of vittayle where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he called them all and bad that they ſhoulde make them ready and arme them, for they were nighe the place that they ſought: and then, as they ſayled away forth, about thrée houres before the euening they ſaw the citie where <hi>Meduſa</hi> was in, and moreouer they ſaw <hi>Meduſa</hi> and her ſiſters with a great number of men of war that were trained on the port, ſo richly arayed and furniſhed ſo that it was meruaile to ſée. When <hi>Perſeus</hi> ſawe this, he diuided his armie in three e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall battailes, each of ten galeys, and ordeyned and put in captaines of war: and wiſely enformed them howe they ſhoulde come nigh and approche the porte. And after he put himſelfe in the firſt battaile: and the poets ſaye, that the goddeſſe <hi>Pallas</hi> gaue to him then a ſhielde of cryſtall: that is to vnderſtand, that he approched right wiſely the port that was vpon the great ſea of <hi>Spayne,</hi> and that he conducted himſelf by ſuch prudence which is likened to criſtal, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he came and fought hand to ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d againſt the puiſſance of <hi>Meduſa:</hi> &amp; that by the ſhining of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> right cleare ſhield of his prudence, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing &amp; giuyng infinit ſtrokes, he gat la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, and conſtrained <hi>Meduſa</hi> to returne to her city, by force of armes, and by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſſe and with a good ordering and fighting of his ſouldiers.

At that time the head ſerpent-like of <hi>Meduſa</hi> might not withſtand his firſt fortunes: for ſhe that was accuſtomed to put vnder foote, and ouercome all them that expoſed them in armes agaynſt her, at this time was put to the ſame extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, that ſhe had put other to.</p>

                     <p>Dame (anſwered one of the Captaines) it is great pitty, that ye were not a man, for if it had béene ſo, it is apparant that ye would haue conquered and put vnder all the monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie of men.

Can yee not riſe ſo early, that we might be on the front of them well arayed, and proued for to fight for the proſperitie of your land? we wil do your requeſt. When <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſa</hi> heard the good will of her captaine, to whom conſented al the other, ſhe was right ioyous, and concluded with them, that ſhe with al her puiſſance would beſet and aſſaile theyr enemies at midnight, in hope to come vppon them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares.

iſſued out of the gate, in rich eſtate, and giuing good morrow to her folke, with as little noyſe as ſhe could, ſhe diuided them into two companies, whereof ſhe made one company to depart by one of the gates of the Citie, and ſhe her ſelfe conducted the other by the gate that was againſt the port or hauen. &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>At this time the aire was pure and cleare, and the ſtarres twinckled: and anon the Moone ſhone, and put away the darkeneſſe of the night according to her celeſtiall office. When <hi>Meduſa</hi> was in the field, ſhe went along by the ſea ſhore, and ſuppoſed to haue taken <hi>Perſeus</hi> and his folke, but ſhe failed: for as ſoone as ſhee iſſued out of her Citie, it was perceiued of the watchmen of the hoſte of <hi>Perſeus,</hi> and they ſignified their comming, to <hi>Perſeus</hi> and his men, that ſlept in their harneſſe. And thus, when ſhe approched vnto her enemies, and had ſuppoſed to haue diſtreſſed them, ſhe founde them readie furniſhed and trained in good order of battaile, wherewith there aroſe a right great crie of both parties, and with this crie there grew a great ſkir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh, ſo eager and fierce, that it was néede vnto all, to put foorth their proweſſes and their ſtrengths. There was many a man caſt downe dead vpon the ſand. There many a ſword died red with bloud.

                     <p>Then when <hi>Perſeus</hi> ſaw that he had not folke inough for to take this port, he withdrew him into the déepe ſea, and ſent into <hi>Naples,</hi> vnto the king <hi>Pilonus,</hi> halfe the treaſures of <hi>Meduſa,</hi> ſignifying to him his hie aduenture, and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him, that he would ſend him a thouſand ſouldiers. The king and <hi>Danae</hi> had great ioy of theſe tydings: and at the requeſt of <hi>Perſeus,</hi> aſſembled fiftéene hundred fighting men, which they ſent into <hi>Libie,</hi> with his owne ſon <hi>Danaus,</hi> whom they ordained chiefe and captaine of the armie. When <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeus</hi> ſaw come theſe fiftéene hundred fighting men, from as far as he had ſpied them in the ſea, he know that it was flying ſuccours
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:7118:87"/>
that came to him, and tooke his flying horſe, and went to méet them, and found there <hi>Danaus</hi> his brother, to whom he made the moſt great cheare of the world, and entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his ſhippe, and there abode all that day feaſting him. And after when it came to be night, hée commaunded his marriners, that they ſhould rowe and ſayle toward <hi>Septe.</hi> And they ſayde to him, that on tho morrow they would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer him at the port. With that the Marriners laboured to do their beſt cunning: ſo that after the night was paſt, about the Sunne ryſing they ſhewed to <hi>Perſeus</hi> the hauen and port of <hi>Septe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then was <hi>Perſeus</hi> full of great gladneſſe, and called <hi>Danaus,</hi> and ſayd to him: my brother, we be now come to the port, where thou ſhalt get this day honour and worſhip, if it pleaſe the gods: for if the good aduenture helpe vs, the honour ſhall appertaine vnto thée before me, that durſt not enterpriſe this alone by my puiſſance.

                     <p>With this word <hi>Perſeus</hi> drew out his ſword, and gaue to <hi>Danaus</hi> the order of knighthoode: and afterward commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that each man ſhould furniſh him with his armours: and then made to diſplay baners, ſtanders, and penons, and other cogniſances, and enſignes of war. After he did cauſe to ſound his trumpettes, clarions and tabours, and then prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all his galeis, and they ſet in right fayre and good order, and ſayled ſo much that he came to the port, which was al ful, and enuyroned with <hi>Libiens</hi> that were ready to caſt on them ſpeares, dartes and ſtones: For they of that countrey were right expert in the warre. And to come a ſhore at this port there was a right great hurliburly, and a very gréeuous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict. <hi>Perſeus</hi> was in <hi>Pegaſe,</hi> and aſſayled the <hi>Libiens</hi> at one ende: and <hi>Danaus</hi> was in the galley, and aſſayled them in likewiſe. And they putte them both in the moſt daunger of the aſſaulte: they hadde great ſhieldes and large, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they couered them.</p>
                     <p>They dreaded no ſtroke of glayne ne ſworde, nor of ſtones: they putte themſelues into the myddeſt of the porte, and there they gaue the aſſaulte: where manye were deade on the one parte, and on the other there were plentye of fighters, in ſuch wiſe that at the entrye there were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye <hi>Apuliens</hi> ouerthrowne and put backe, for they were then hote and eager: but after this, when they hadde gotten lande, <hi>Perſeus</hi> and <hi>Danaus</hi> beganne to ſmyte ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaſurably vpon the <hi>Lybiens,</hi> that they beate them downe without remedye, nowe heere nowe there, at the right ſide, and at the left ſide, all made red with theyr bloud.

All the yong men and women were fled vnto the fields, and had abandoned the Citie with their folke and goods. When <hi>Perſeus</hi> and <hi>Dardanus</hi> were within, and ſawe that it was abandoned to them and their people, they tooke all that they founde, and paſſed that night with great ioy &amp; gladnes, making great cheare, and thanking their goddes of their victorie that they had giuen to them.

                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Pricus</hi> then hauing vſurped from his brother <hi>Acriſius</hi> the ſeignorie of the Realme of <hi>Argos,</hi> had a wife named <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was ſo brought vp, that of cuſtome ſhe had no delight, but to liue in voluptuouſneſſe. And on a day ſhée beheld a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong her ſeruants one ſo comely a knight, that nature had nothing forgotten in him touching his bodie: of whom ſhe was enamoured. Shee was yong, and her huſband <hi>Pricus</hi> was ancient in his demeanure &amp; conditions, and much leſſe deſired carnall concupiſcence then his wife did, though they were both right neare one age. This knight thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued, hadde to name <hi>Bellerophon.</hi> When <hi>Aurea</hi> had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne to loue this knight, ſhe ſolicited him with her eyes, and with her countenances, drawing him to delight and fleſhly luſt. But the true knight, that had his heart firme and ſtable, which perceiued well her countenance, diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muled, and fained that he was blinde in this part. And in the ende when the Ladie ſawe that by countenance nor ſigne amorous that ſhe ſhewed, he employed him not once for to pleaſe her, but fled her companie: in the moſt euill wiſe that ſhe might, ſhee intended to turne her loue into hate, and her faire countenances into fierce malice, ſo enue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimed, that for to make him die, ſhée accuſed him before her huſband the king <hi>Pricus,</hi> ſaying, that he would haue enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced her, wherefore ſhe required iuſtice inſtantly.</p>
                     <p>At this accuſation made, <hi>Bellerophon</hi> was preſent, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſore abaſhed, and aſtoniſhed at the beginning, but
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:7118:90"/>
hearing the Ladie ſpeake, at length he cleared himſelfe, and excuſed him, ſaying: Madame neuer pleaſe it vnto the gods, that for to couer mine honour, I do diſcouer the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worſhip and fault of another. Let neuer man aduance him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe by defaming another: This knowing, I will ſay the truth, and if there bee any man that may worthily prooue this againſt me, and ouercome me, no bleſſing to my heart. I will ſtand to the iudgement of all noble men that haue knowne my behauiour. Alas ladie, from whence is come this abuſion, for to charge me that I ſhould haue willed to enforce you? when or in what place was it doone, or where be the witneſſes of the crie that ye made at the affray? where be the prooues that ſhall ſay that euer in my life I was with you alone? It giueth me maruaile from what heart depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this diſhonour that ye note in me? and for what cauſe it is imagined againſt me? for I will well that all the world know, that I haue ſerued you truely and loyally, and that I neuer thought diſhonour vnto you nor vnto the king, to whom I pray that he will take and make information vpon my liuing, and to vnderſtand in like wiſe yours. And if it can be prooued and appeare that I haue treſpaſſed, that I may be puniſhed: but I pray alſo, if I be founde inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, that I may haue ſpéedy abſolution.</p>
                     <p>Syr ſaid the Ladie, that ſtrongly was obſtinate in her er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, I make me partie againſt him. If then I accuſe him, it is truth, it ought not to demand witneſſes of his follie. In this caſe I am worth two witneſſes: for all the world know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that when an ill man will diſhonour a woman, he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth no witneſſes nor no prooues thereto, but doth his dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable will the moſt ſecretly that in him is poſſible. And ſo wéened <hi>Bellerophon</hi> to haue doone with mée, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I require ſentence and iudgement of him. With theſe wordes, <hi>Pricus</hi> aſſembled his Councell, and it was iudged that the ladie ſhoulde bee beléeued, and that <hi>Bellerophon</hi> ſhould bee culpable of death. Then ſpake <hi>Pricus</hi> to <hi>Bellerophon</hi> and ſaid. Faire ſonne, thou knoweſt
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:7118:90"/>
and haſt found that I haue loued and nouriſhed thée louing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: thou vnderſtandeſt the accuſation of thy Ladie, the caſe is ſo foule, that it may not be purged by denying. For if it were ſo, the euill boyes and had fellowes, would all day diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour as many of our women as they could find. In this caſe the Ladyes haue a prerogatiue for to be beléeued, and néede not to bring forth witneſſes, And foraſmuch as thy miſtres hath vanquiſhed thée, and required iudgement of thy treſpaſſe, thou art condemned to die. But foraſmuch as before this time I haue had great loue vnto thée, and that I knowe thée a valiant man of thy bodie, I will mitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate and attemper this ſentence in this wiſe, that thou ſhalt go fight agaynſt the Chymere of <hi>Sicill,</hi> and if thou mayſt ouercome and maiſter her, I giue thée thy life, and giue thée plaine abſolution of all, vpon condition that neuer after thou renue nor rehearſe this treſpaſſe.</p>
                     <p>Sir (anſwered <hi>Bellerophon</hi>) ſith that fortune conſents, that I be attainted of any infelicitie: and that the priuiledge of the Ladies take place, and go aboue reaſon: I had much leuer to be vanquiſhed by wrong cauſe and euil, then by iuſt and good cauſe, and thanke you of the moderation of your iudgement, and make vow here in your preſence, that in all haſte I will go into <hi>Sicil,</hi> to proue me againſt the Chimere, and will ſée if fortune will helpe me to get againe the life, which ſhe hath made me loſe by your iudgement. Then the noble knight departed, and tooke leaue of the king, of the ladies and damoſels, tooke alſo his armours, and goods, and made couenant and bargained with certaine marriners, to bring him to <hi>Sicill.</hi> When they were agréed, he went to the ſea with little companie, and was euill at eaſe at his heart, when hee ſawe that Fortune was to him ſo contrarie: yet hee comforted him ſelfe in his good quarrell: and ſayling on a daye on the Sea of <hi>Helleſponte,</hi> his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryners looked into the Weſt, and ſawe come a right great floate of Shippes of warre, which diſcomforted them ſo ſorrowfully, that it was wonder, and they awooke
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:7118:91"/>
                        <hi>Bellerophon</hi> that at that time ſlept, and ſaide that they were but dead and caſt away.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bellerophon</hi> comforted his marriners the beſt wiſe hee could, and told them that diſcomfort could not helpe them: and as he was thus ſpeaking, a gallie of aduantage went out afore his fellowes, and flying on the ſea like vnto a bird adreſſed her vnto the ſhip, wherein was <hi>Bellerophon,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borded it. And who that will demaund what the name was of the gallie, and what men were therin: I wil ſay to them, that this was <hi>Pegaſe,</hi> and that <hi>Perſeus</hi> was within it. As ſoone as he might ſpeake to the marriners that caried <hi>Belle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rophon</hi> to <hi>Sicyll,</hi> hee aſked and demanded them, what they were, and into what region they would go? When <hi>Bellero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon</hi> heard <hi>Perſeus</hi> ſpeake, hee behelde his behauiour and countenance, and iudged in himſelfe that he was of a good houſe, and ſaid to him: Certes ſir I haue much great ioy, for that I ſée the ſhip and marriners be ſo well adreſſed, and in ſo good readineſſe as yours be, for ye ſéeme well a knight of a noble houſe, and therefore I tell you my caſe, afterthat ye haue made your aſking. Firſt then, where ye enquired what we bee, knowe ye that in <hi>Argos</hi> wee haue taken our birth: And as to the ſecond, I anſwere you, that we haue a purpoſe to go ſtraight into <hi>Sicill,</hi> to the which I am conſtrained by the rigour of a mortall iudgement, caſt vppon mee at the inſtance of a Ladye called <hi>Aurea,</hi> that vniuſtly and vntruely hath complained vppon mee, ſaying that I would haue enforced her. This Ladye that I ſpeake of, is wife to king <hi>Prycus,</hi> which newly and of late hath baniſhed and exiled his Brother <hi>Acriſius</hi> out of his Realme, and this King, for to pleaſe and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfie the accuſations of his wife, hath condemned mée to be put to death, yet for the good and the acceptable ſeruice that I haue doone to him, hée hath graunted me to liue, if ſo it pleaſe the goddes, that I may by poſſibilitie vanquiſh and ouercome a Chimere that is in <hi>Sicill,</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the which I go for to aſſay mee. So I pray you that
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:7118:91"/>
in our miſfortune, we be not let by you, neither by none of your companie.</p>
                     <p>Valiant knight (anſwered <hi>Perſeus</hi>) as it is true that the heart of a noble man taketh pitie, and compaſſion in the diſtreſſe and paſſion of his equall: the weighing of your caſe hath pearced mine heart with a charitable mercie and pitie, by which yée may ſurely vnderſtand, not to haue by vs any hinderance during your infortunate life. And for as much as the hearts of them that would be induced at calling to the déedes of Armes, ſingularly delyte them in aduentures of great woorth and weight to get credite by, I will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companie you, for two cauſes. The firſt is, to expoſe my ſelfe to the diſputation and deſtruction of the Chimere, if it happen that you ouercome her not, which I ſuppoſe yée can not. And the ſecond is, that after the Chimere be vanquiſhed, I may be guided by you vnto the Realme of <hi>Argos.</hi> For from nowe forth, I will be enemie vnto the King <hi>Pricus,</hi> for the ſake of the father of my mother the King <hi>Acriſius.</hi> And for to let you haue more greater knowledge of this matter, I tell you that I am ſonne to <hi>Danae:</hi> that verie ſame ſonne that was conceyued in the tower <hi>Dardan,</hi> of the ſéede of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and that ſame in perſon, that king <hi>Acriſius</hi> made caſt into the ſea. But this notwithſtanding, I ſhall take no vengeaunce on his demerites, but for the honour of the blood, and of the wombe of whom I am iſſued, I ſhall ſuccour and ayde him, and pray you that ye will be my fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe and brother in armes, and that ye will come into my Galley, and ſend home againe your marriners into their countreys, if it pleaſe you.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Bellerophon</hi> heard the good wordes and aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere of <hi>Perſeus,</hi> he made alliances with him, and entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Galley, and gaue leaue to his marriners, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with him <hi>Perſeus</hi> and <hi>Danaus,</hi> that for loue of him took their way into <hi>Sicil,</hi> where they arriued in ſpace of time, and tooke land: and that ſame day <hi>Bellerophon</hi> armed him, deſiring to finde the Chimer, and tooke leaue of <hi>Perſeus,</hi> in
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:7118:92"/>
ſuch wiſe, as he that put him in perill of death. The Ports write that this Chimere had the head of a Lion, the wombe of a goate, and the taile of a ſerpent, but for truth it was a mountaine inhabitable, that had in height aboue a paſſing great caue of Lions, and in the middle of the hill it was full of goates, And at the foote beneath, it was enuironed and ſet round about with ſerpents. Theſe lions and ſerpents were paſſing damageable, and noyous vnto the countrey about and nigh. When <hi>Bellerophon</hi> then ſaw the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, he went thither, and <hi>Perſeus</hi> and <hi>Danaus</hi> followed him. They had not long marched, when they ſawe and behelde more then a thouſand little Serpents with many great Dragons, of whome ſome came about <hi>Bellerophon</hi> and caſt out theyr venime, and the other paſſed foorth, and came running vppon <hi>Perſeus</hi> and <hi>Danaus,</hi> which hadde promiſed to <hi>Bellerophon,</hi> that they would there doo no déeds nor enterpriſe of arms, but if it were by conſtraint, and in defending their bodies.</p>
                     <p>Anon as theſe thrée valiant knights ſawe theſe curſed beaſts, they tooke their ſwords and ſmote vpon them, and be headed many of them, but with this they had great paine and trauaile, for theſe beaſts were cruell and full of pride, and hardened them eagerly to them, and if they had not béene well prouided with abillements of warre, they had there ſooner haue found death then life. <hi>Bellerophon</hi> went al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way afore, and ſmote downe right, and headed, and ſmote into péeces many. <hi>Perſeus</hi> nor his Brother <hi>Dana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> fought not, but with the beaſts onely that came vppon them. When <hi>Bellerophon</hi> had a little ceaſed the fight and battaile againſt this vermin, and had found it more ſharpe and more biting, (for the point of his ſword was made terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly blunt, with ſmiting againſt their hard ſcales and ſkinnes) then there leapt downe and out of their holes the goates and the lions, and came downe for to aſſaile the the knight, in ſo great number, that hee was all enuironed with them, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="167" facs="tcp:7118:92"/>Some of theſe beaſtes eſcaped from him and came to <hi>Perſeus,</hi> and gaue him his hands full to employ his ſtrength and proweſſe: the Lions leapt about the necke of <hi>Bellero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon,</hi> ſometime in ſuch number, that in no part he might be ſeene. Yet by his abilitie he could well ſaue himſelfe, but he had neuer eſcaped, there came ſo much venome vpon him there, and beaſts, and on <hi>Perſeus</hi> and <hi>Danaus,</hi> which ſo fiercely aſſayled them, and if hee had not woonne a rocke, vpon which he gat vp with great paine, and right great ſweate of his bodie. For to go vpon this rocke, there was but one ſtraight way. Then compaſſed him the Lions, and with them the other beaſts, which ſtayed on the way of the rocke, and at the foote, roring and making great noyſe about him, ſo that <hi>Perſeus</hi> and <hi>Danaus</hi> had none other hope for the knight, but that it had béene his laſt day: for he had ſo many beaſts about him that it was likely, that the edge and cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of his ſword might not long endure, without it had béen worne or broken. Then the Lions when they might not touch his bodie, bote the ſtones, and did teare them with their clawes, the ſerpents flew vp into the aire, and lifted vp theyr bodies vpon their tayles, and caſt fire and ſmoke out of their throtes vnto the rocke. And the moſt hardeſt of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, one after another trained themſelues in battell againſt him, and ſhewed their téeth, receyuing his ſtrokes ſore ſet. And they fled not, but abode as beaſts familiar and ſore co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous of mans blood, in who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> raigned excéeding great fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, as much as in any wild beaſt of the world at that time.</p>
                     <p>Hard and maruailous was the battaile, as <hi>Perſeus</hi> and <hi>Danaus</hi> beheld, and thought in what faſhion they might ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour <hi>Bellerophon.</hi> The noble knight defended him to his power, and ſéeking howe he might ſaue him from this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill, he caſt his eyes vpon a great ſtone that hanged ouer the way of the rocke, wherevpon he was mounted, and then he thought if he might make that ſtone to fall downe, that hée ſhould flea the moſt part of the beaſts. Then he beganne a little and a little to wag the ſtone, and to ſéeke the ioyntures
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:7118:93"/>
that held it, and ſo much laboured, that in the end he made it fall vpon the lions, ſerpents, and goates, in ſuch wiſe as in the falling he made all the rocke to tremble, and feared in generall theſe vnhappie beaſts, ſo that they were there all bruiſed, like as the thunder had come vpon them, and yet that more is, with the tumbling downe, it made the rocke that <hi>Bellorophon</hi> ſtood on ſo ſhake, that he tumbled downe thereon, and was ſo aſtonied, that hee wiſt not whether it was day or night.</p>
                     <p>The ſtone was great, and brought downe many ſtones with him, <hi>Perſeus</hi> and <hi>Danaus</hi> thought at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that all the mountaines had tumbled downe, and were not well aſſured in themſelues.

                     <p>When <hi>Perſeus</hi> had vnderſtoode that there was bounde this mayde, he deſired to ſee her, for the meruailous iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that was giuen vpon her, and arayed him with rich veſtiments and cloathes and then iſſued out of the galey, and tooke out alſo <hi>Bellerophon</hi> which might not yet help himſelf, and after he went vnto <hi>Andromeda.</hi> There were her pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes and couſins in great number, which labored in ſorow and great plentye of teares. When <hi>Perſeus</hi> ſawe this mayde that was paſſing fayre in her degrée, which neuer ſawe her like or match, he hadde pittie of her, and ſayde to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, that if hee might hée woulde delyuer her from this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill. Then hée called her friendes, and ſayde vnto them in the preſence of <hi>Amon:</hi> I haue certainly great pittie and compaſſion of this ſo faire a damoſel: and alſo am amaſed how
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:7118:95"/>
the goddes ſuffer and endure that ſhe is ſo fortuned in her tender yeares. If it ſo happened y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhe might haue any knight or noble man, that would vnbinde her, and for charitie expoſe his body againſt the monſter for the loue of her, ſhould ſhe be quite? They aunſwered yea: Ah then ſaid <hi>Perſeus,</hi> if I wold for her ſake aduenture my ſelfe in this worke: and if it ſo fortuned that I had the grace to ouercome and ſurmount the monſter and for to put him to the foyle, will ye be content that the mayde be my wife? They aunſwered yea, yea. And I promiſe you, ſayd <hi>Perſeus,</hi> and ſweare, that ſhe hath found me, a knight that ſhall put his body and life in ieopardye for her. &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>With this word <hi>Perſeus</hi> ſent to fetche his armes: and after went to the Damoſell and vnbound her from the ſtone, and deliuered her to her friendes and kinſmen. Saynt <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> in the booke of the citie of God, rehearſeth, that yet in the ſame porte is the ſtone that <hi>Andromeda</hi> was bounde vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that they of <hi>Ioppe</hi> kept for a ſigne and memorye of the victorye that <hi>Perſeus</hi> had of the monſter. All they that were there, meruailed greatly at the enterpriſe of the knight, and knowing the monſter, they iudged him to be but dead, alowing his hardines that to them ſéemed was too great. One and other ſpake of this matter. <hi>Perſeus</hi> armed him ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly. When he was armed, he came to <hi>Andromeda</hi> and kiſſ her, taking leaue of her, and ſayd, fayre mayde, praye ye vnto the goddes for your champion, that for your loue ſubmitteth himſelfe vnto the perill of death, to the ende that by your onely meane I maye come vnto the enioying of loue, and that we togither maye be ioyned in maryage, which I buye at the price of my life. Noble Knight, aunſwered the mayde, I am more beholding to you then to all my kinſmen and fréendes. Knowe ye, that if my prayers may obtayne of the goddes, ye ſhall returne ſafe from this enterpryſe. Then <hi>Perſeus</hi> wente before the ſtone, and <hi>Andromeda</hi> knéeled with great humilitie, with both her knées vpon the earth, in calling on her gods to help her champion, and there
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:7118:95"/>
were many matrones vpon the banke of the Sea, that for compaſſion put them in contemplation, and by this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of them all, the <hi>Siriens</hi> beganne to pray for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperitie of the Knight, excepting onely the king <hi>Phineus,</hi> which prayed for his death. And that for this cauſe, for as much as before the iudgement giuen on <hi>Andromeda,</hi> hée had fianced and betrothed him to her. So had he wiſhed, that the monſter had deuoured <hi>Perſeus.</hi> to the ende that the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of him and of her might haue béene ended. What ſhall I ſay more? When <hi>Perſeus</hi> had ſo put himſelfe foorth by the ſtone, he looked towarde the ſea, and helde in his hande a good and paſſing ſtrong ſworde, and he had not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>helde the ſituation, and taken leaſure to ſée the place, when there ſprang out of a ſwalow or depth of the ſea, a monſter ſo great and ſo horrible, and ſo dreadfull, that it ſéemed that he had béene made for to deſtroy all the worlde: hee was rough and went on foure féete like a beaſt, and his forme was ſo diſfigured, that none wiſt whereto he might be likened.</p>
                     <p>When then the <hi>Syriens</hi> ſawe him put his head out of the déepe, there was none ſo well aſſured, but he trembled for feare. And many were ſo afrayed, that they fled into their houſes, and reentred into their Citie. This notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, <hi>Perſeus</hi> as ſoone as he ſawe him riſe vp, he came to him as hardie and right well aſſured, and ſmote him with the poynt of his ſworde, ſo full vpon the right eye, that on that ſide he made him blinde, whereof the monſter felt ſo great paine, that he came out of the Sea with open mouth, and thought to haue ſwallowed <hi>Perſeus.</hi> And <hi>Perſeus</hi> went backe a little, and put his ſworde betwéene his iawes into his throate, ſo farre foorth, that he could not draw it out againe, and ſo of force it abode in his throate more then foure foote.</p>
                     <p>At the ſecond ſtroke the monſter made a maruaſlous crie, lifting vp his head, and wéening to haue caſt out the péece of the ſworde which abode in his throate, but it would

not bée. Alwaye the monſter aſſayled <hi>Perſeus</hi> and wéend to haue ſwalowed him into his throate: and <hi>Perſeus</hi> alwaye ſtroke at him with his ſword, and put him at defence, and ſmote alway at his throte, and about nigh his other eye, and ſo well intended the worke, that after he had giuen him ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny woundes he made him blynde on the left eye, like as hée did on the right eye. And then as the monſter went héere and there, and made many walkes without ſéeing or knowing where he went, purſuing his enemy, <hi>Perſeus</hi> gaue him ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye woundes, ſearching his heart, and at the laſt he founde it. And finallye he beſtirred him ſo that he pearſed the heart, with which ſtroke he made him to fall downe dead.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XXXVII. ¶Howe Perſeus reeſtabliſhed in his Realme the king Acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius: and how he ſlue the King by euill aduenture.</head>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N <hi>Thebes</hi> there refreſhed them theſe <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puliens,</hi> and made alliance with the king, after they departed from thence, and tooke their way by land toward <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gos,</hi> vnder and by the conduct of <hi>Belle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rephon,</hi> that then was whole, &amp; healed of his foote, who knew wel the country. When <hi>Bellerophon</hi> had guided them ſo nigh <hi>Argos,</hi> that in an houre they might runne before the gates, he ſignified it vnto <hi>Perſeus,</hi> and then <hi>Perſeus</hi> made his hoſt to tarrie in a Valley, and ſent <hi>Danaus</hi> vnto the King <hi>Pricus,</hi> to ſummon him that hee ſhould yéelde the Realme vnto the King <hi>Acriſius. Danaus</hi> went to <hi>Argos,</hi> and accompliſhed the ſummons. The king <hi>Pricus</hi> anſwered to him, that he was king, and that he woulde holde that hée helde: and menaced <hi>Perſeus</hi> vnto the death, if he departed not the Countrey haſtily. <hi>Danaus</hi> returned vnto the hoſt of <hi>Perſeus</hi> with this aunſwere, and made to him the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. <hi>Perſeus</hi> then hoped that king <hi>Pricus</hi> would come to him, and giue him battaile, and had thereof right great ioy and pleaſure: for hee deſired nothing in the world more, then to bée in armes: and for to be the better able to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand his fo, he ordayned that night, that he would depart his battaile in thrée: whereof hee gaue charge of the firſt battaile to <hi>Bellerophon,</hi> which require and deſired of him the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <pb n="178" facs="tcp:7118:98"/>
that knew of theyr coming by his eſpyes, and had ſet his bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile in good order.</p>

                        <hi>Belleropho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        </hi> had with him but two thouſand fighting men. When the king <hi>Pricus</hi> ſawe him come with ſo little a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, he ſuppoſed that it had bin <hi>Perſeus,</hi> and thought to haue had all woon before hand by aduantage, and made his people to ſet againſt them, by which within ſhort ſpace began a cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell and hard battaile. And of this battaile was <hi>Pricus</hi> right ioyous at the aſſembly, and well imployed his armes and his ſword, and did meruails, but at that time he ſuppoſed by force to haue abidden victoryous and conqueror of his enimies, he caſte his eyes toward <hi>Thebes,</hi> and ſawe <hi>Perſeus</hi> and his bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, that diſcouered and ſhewed himſelfe: wherein his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune was ſuch, that in the beholding the head of <hi>Meduſa,</hi> which he bare painted in his ſheelde of criſtall, he and all his folke, in a momente, were turned all into ſtones. That is to ſaye, that he and all his meanie hadde loſt their ſtrengthes and courages, and that they might no more lifte theyr ſwordes then might the ſtatues or images. And that <hi>Prycus</hi> fled, and all they that coulde, fled ſome into the cittie, and ſome into the fieldes at all aduenture. <hi>Perſeus</hi> daigned not to followe the chaſe, becauſe of theyr poore caſe. And thus <hi>Prycus</hi> eſcaped the death, and abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and gaue ouer the country, and went with them that fled into <hi>Calidonie,</hi> where he was afterward put to death by <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules.</hi> And <hi>Perſeus</hi> went into the citie of <hi>Argos,</hi> whereof the gates were open and without any men that made any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. When he was in the citie, he made an edict charging vpon paine of death, that none be ſo hardy to vſe any force nor violence there. After that he ſente to ſéeke his grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Acriſius,</hi> and told him who he was, and ſo deliuered to him again his citie and his realme.</p>
                     <p>Of this curteſie <hi>Acriſius</hi> held himſelfe greatly beholden vnto <hi>Perſeus,</hi> and aſked him, &amp; enquired of his daughter <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae,</hi> and of theyr aduentures. <hi>Perſeus</hi> tolde him all that he knewe; and then <hi>Acriſius</hi> was right ſore diſpleaſante at
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:7118:98"/>
that hard vſage that he had doone: and for to amende all, hée adopted <hi>Perſeus</hi> to his ſonne, and gaue him the full power to gouerne the citie, and himſelfe with drewe him into the towre of <hi>Dardane</hi> and then ſent againe vnto <hi>Naples, Darda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> his brother, with whome went <hi>Bellerophon:</hi> and hee gaue vnto them and to their companye, great treaſors at theyr departing. <hi>Perſeus</hi> ſente manye <hi>Arigiens</hi> into <hi>Licie?</hi> and made them to inhabite the countrey. And thus abode <hi>Perſeus</hi> in <hi>Argos</hi> with his wife <hi>Andromeda,</hi> of whome hée gat many children, That is to wéete, <hi>Sthelenus, Blache Demon, Erictreus</hi> and <hi>Gorgophon,</hi> which all became men, and tooke wiues, yet reigning the King <hi>Acriſius.</hi> And among all other <hi>Gorgophon,</hi> had one wife, of whome hée hadde two ſonnes <hi>Alceus,</hi> and <hi>Electrion, Alceus</hi> engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>Amphitrion,</hi> and <hi>Electrion,</hi> engendred <hi>Alcumena,</hi> of whome came <hi>Hercules.</hi> What ſhall I make long proceſſe of the factes and of the generations of this <hi>Perſeus.</hi> He go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned paſſing well the realme, and loued much the King <hi>Acriſius:</hi> But there fell an hard fortune vnto him in the ende, for as he went on a night alone vnto the towre of <hi>Dardane</hi> to viſit the king, the garders and kéepers of the Tower knewe him not, and fell vpon him and hurte him. When he felte him ſmitten hée put himſelfe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. The noyſe waxed great, the king heard the noiſe, he came running downe for to parte the fray, thruſted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the preaſe, in ſuche wiſe that <hi>Perſeus</hi> knewe him not, and with his ſword hee ſo ſmote him, that he ſlew him and all the people with him: and anon after, when he came in, and founde him dead, he remembred and thought he hadde put him to death after the prognoſtication of the goddes, and made great ſorrowe, and did ordeyne his obſequie right ſolemnlye. And at this obſequy happened for to be there, <hi>Iupiter</hi> and his ſonne <hi>Vulcan,</hi> which at that time practyſed togither the ſcience of magike and nigroman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cye. &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>At this tyme <hi>Vulcan</hi> forged and wrought the thunders
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:7118:99"/>
vnto <hi>Iupiter.</hi> That is to ſay, that he buſied himſelfe with ſmiting and troubling by fire and ſworde, the Realmes of his neighbours, and the Poetes ſay and make many fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of him, whereof néedeth to make no mention at this time. <hi>Perſeus</hi> then did great honour and worſhip vnto his father <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and in likewiſe did <hi>Iupiter</hi> vnto <hi>Perſeus.</hi> And each told other, and rehearſed their aduentures. But when the obſequie was done of King <hi>Acriſius,</hi> and <hi>Iupiter</hi> beheld and ſawe <hi>Perſeus</hi> ſo heauie that he could haue no ioy, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned into <hi>Crete</hi> vnto his wife <hi>Iuno,</hi> and there he exerciſed himſelfe in the ſcience of Magicke. And then when <hi>Perſeus</hi> found himſelfe alone in <hi>Argos,</hi> and ſaw that he might reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer there no ioy, he departed from thence, and went vnto the citie of <hi>Miſene,</hi> but he raigned there not long, foraſmuch as the death of <hi>Acriſius</hi> renued alway, and he could not put it out of his minde, and ſo he departed thence, and withdrewe him with a great hoſt into the Orient, where he gat and conquered by armes, a great Countrey, which he named <hi>Perſia,</hi> after his name, and there founded the Citie called <hi>Perſepolis,</hi> after that he had vanquiſhed and put to death <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berpater,</hi> which made him warre. And then when he had ſo done, he purueied for his children in ſuch wiſe, that his two ſonnes, <hi>Alceus</hi> and <hi>Electrion,</hi> with <hi>Amphitrion</hi> and <hi>Alcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena,</hi> dwelled in <hi>Thebes,</hi> and <hi>Brachman</hi> reigned in <hi>Perſia, Erictreus</hi> vpon the red ſea, and <hi>Stelenus</hi> in <hi>Miſene.</hi> But to ſpeake of them all I will ceaſe at this time, and wil tell one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of <hi>Amphitrion,</hi> and <hi>Alcumena,</hi> that loued ſo well togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that they tooke day the one to wed the other. And the cauſe that mooued me to write of theſe two, is foraſmuch as of <hi>Alcumena</hi> came <hi>Hercules,</hi> who firſt deſtroyed <hi>Troy,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this time when <hi>Iupiter</hi> came againe into <hi>Crete,</hi> and that he with <hi>Vulcan</hi> his ſonne and <hi>Iuno</hi> practiſed by theyr ſtudye, the ſcy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Magike: after that, that <hi>Vulcan</hi> had forged the thunders of <hi>Iupiter, Amphitrion</hi> wedded the fayre <hi>Alcumena,</hi> in the Cittie of <hi>Thebes,</hi> with great honour, and alſo with great companye of Kings, Quéenes and of Ladyes. The feaſt of this wedding was great. <hi>Iupiter</hi> the King of <hi>Crete,</hi> and the Quéene <hi>Iuno</hi> were there. During the feaſt, <hi>Iupiter</hi> continually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>helde <hi>Alcumena,</hi> for her great beautie (for <hi>Alcumena</hi> was the moſt fayre woman that euer was ſéene) all his delight, and all his buſie care was in the beholding the ladyes. He deſired nothing but for to bée alwaye among the ladyes, and alway had the eye vpon them. But in the ende he behelde <hi>Alcumena</hi> moſt in eſpeciall, in whome he had a ſingular pleaſure. In the great aboundance of his ſight, he ſo ſore fixed his eye on her excellencie, that his heart beganne to be troubled, in ſuch wiſe that he was amorous and coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous of her loue. In this his ſo greedye coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſnes and deſiring, he let paſſe the ſolemnitie of the wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and returned into <hi>Crete:</hi> but he had not long ſoiourned when the ſayde couetouſnes ſo wrought vehemently in him, that on a day he began to ſpeake of <hi>Alcumena,</hi> in the preſence of <hi>Iuno.</hi> And ſayd vnto <hi>Ganimedes</hi> his Eſquire: <hi>Ganimedes,</hi> what ſéemeth you of the beautie of <hi>Alcumena?</hi> Syr, ſayd the Eſquire, me thinketh, ſhe ſhineth in all manner excellencie
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:7118:100"/>
of a Lady, and for that to compriſe all her vertues, there is no king ſo great, but that he might well ſéeme to be of ally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with one that is of leſſe beautie then ſhe is.</p>
                     <p>When the Quéene <hi>Iuno</hi> vnderſtoode that <hi>Iupiter</hi> talked ſo much of <hi>Alcumena,</hi> at that ſame time ſhe was ſore mooued with new ielouſie: For ſhe had often times béene ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and thought in her ſelfe, that if ſhe might, ſhe would cauſe to flie and put to death <hi>Alcumena.</hi> After theſe ſpéeches, <hi>Iupiter</hi> found himſelfe ſore intangled and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome with loue, and for to ouermaiſter it, and to let it paſſe, hee tooke his bow and arrowes, in purpoſe to go to the wood for to ſlea ſome wilde beaſt. And went forth accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied onely with <hi>Ganimedes,</hi> but as ſoone as hee was iſſued out of the gate, there came and met him one of the knights of <hi>Thebes,</hi> and did reuerence vnto the king, and ſayde vnto him, that the king <hi>Creon</hi> of <hi>Thebes</hi> ſent him vnto him, and required him that he would aide and helpe him to warre againſt the king of <hi>Thelipoly,</hi> that had treſpaſſed againſt him. When the king <hi>Iupiter</hi> had heard the meſſage of the king, he was right ioyous of the requeſt of the king of <hi>Thebes,</hi> and tooke the knight by the hand, and brought him to his pallace, and there feaſted him, and made him right good chéere, and after he ſaide, that with right good heart and will, he would ſuccour and helpe the king <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> in his warre. The knight of <hi>Thebes</hi> with this anſwer tooke leaue of king <hi>Iupiter,</hi> &amp; returned vnto <hi>Thebes.</hi> Where preparation and ordinance was made to go vnto <hi>Thelipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> It was not long after that the King <hi>Iupiter</hi> made his armie, and haſted him as much as hée might, that ſhortly ſhe might come to the houſe of <hi>Thebes,</hi> where hée hoped to finde <hi>Alcumena.</hi> When all thing was ready he tooke his way, and ſped him in his iourney, that he came to <hi>Thebes,</hi> where he was right honourably and worthily receiued of the King, the Quéene, and of the ladye. The king <hi>Iupiter</hi> at his comming forgat not to looke, if he might ſée <hi>Alcumena:</hi> but hee ſawe her not, wherefore hée was
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:7118:100"/>
in great gréefe, and wiſt not what to do. And he looked after <hi>Amphitrion,</hi> but he could no where ſée him, whereat he was more abaſhed then he was before. In this abaſhement he approched to King <hi>Creon,</hi> and demaunded of him, where <hi>Amphitrion</hi> was? The King <hi>Creon,</hi> anſwered him, that he woulde ſhortlye come, and that he aſſembled his men of armes at the Caſtle of <hi>Arciancie,</hi> which he hadde giuen him. This Caſtle ſtoode betweene <hi>Thebes</hi> and <hi>Athens</hi> vpon the riuer, and was a paſſing fayre place and ſtrong. Anon as <hi>Iupiter</hi> had vnderſtoode, that king <hi>Creon</hi> had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen <hi>Arciancie</hi> to <hi>Amphitrion,</hi> he imagined ſoone that <hi>Alcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena</hi> was in that place. and was in will to haue gon to that place if it had not béen that he dreaded the talking of the people, and alſo he feared to make <hi>Amphitrion</hi> ielous. This conſidered, the king <hi>Iupiter</hi> abode in <hi>Thebes</hi> not well pleaſed, for aſmuch as hée might not ſée <hi>Alcumena,</hi> and paſſed there that time the beſt wiſe he coulde, till <hi>Amphitrion</hi> &amp; other were come. Then they departed from <hi>Thebes</hi> from the king <hi>Creon,</hi> and went for to laye ſiege to the citie of <hi>Thellipolye,</hi> accompanied with the king <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and many other. During the ſiege, they of the citie aſſayled oft time by battayle againe their enemies, but they of <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes</hi> had alwaye ſo good fortune, that in the ende they of <hi>Thellipolye</hi> yéelded them in all poyntes to the will of king <hi>Creon:</hi> and thus when the king of <hi>Thebes</hi> had ouercome and ſubdued the citie, he returned vnto his countrey with great ioy. &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Amphitrion</hi> ſawe that their enimies were ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and that there was no more perill, he had great deſire to go ſée his wife <hi>Alcumena:</hi> and for to haſt him the more ſooner to bee with her, he departed from the hoſte, with leaue of the king, accompanyed with an Eſquire onely. When king <hi>Iupiter</hi> ſawe <hi>Amphitrion</hi> ſo departe vpon his waye, he began to thinke and aduiſe him of a great ſubtilty, for to come to his intent. And he departed from the hoſte with <hi>Ganimedes</hi> onely: and as ſoone as hée was in the fielde
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:7118:101"/>
on the waye they two being togither, <hi>Iupiter</hi> entred into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with <hi>Ganimedes,</hi> and ſayd to him: <hi>Ganimedes,</hi> I haue great affiance in you, and more then in any man that liueth, wherefore I will tell you priuily a thing ſecrete, which I ſhall accompliſh as I hope: And ye muſt holde and kéepe it ſecret. Truth it is that I am amorous terribly of dame <hi>Alcumena.</hi> By no meane in the world I maye yet forget her, nor put her from my deſire. She knoweth not the payne that for her loue aboundeth in me, for I neuer was ſo har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to diſcouer to her my caſe, nor neuer durſt ſhewe it to her, for as much as I knowe her wiſe, chaſte and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous. This conſidered, thinking on this thing, I féele and finde me full of troubles, and confeſſe my follye, for I am in a manner in diſpayre nowe: inaſmuch as I had ſuppoſed to haue founde the like anſwere of loue in <hi>Alcume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na.</hi> But the ſodaine departing of <hi>Amphitrion</hi> yet giueth me in a maner an hope, for at the time that I ſawe him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parte from the hoſte, for to go ſée his wife accompanyed with his Eſquire, I imagined that in all haſte I would go vnto <hi>Arciancie,</hi> by a more néere and ſhorter waye: For I know the paſſage long ſince, and that I would tranſfigure my ſelfe into the forme of <hi>Amphitrion,</hi> and you into the forme of his Eſquire, for to go vnto <hi>Alcumena,</hi> and to make her vnderſtande that I were <hi>Amphitrion. Ganimedes,</hi> vpon this intention and purpoſe, I am come on the way, to go thither with you, we muſt néedes win vpon <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phitrion</hi> this waye a night and daye, and therefore lette vs go now merylye. Mée thinketh that loue ſhall helpe me, and when <hi>Alcumena</hi> ſhall ſée me tranſformed into the ſhape of <hi>Amphitrio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> and you as his Eſquire, ſhée ſhal not be ſo wiſe to perceiue mine enchauntment.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ganimedes</hi> hearkened right diligently to the wil and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and promiſed that he wold imploy him in this affaire as much as in him was poſſible, and ſo they rode with good will and great deſire the readieſt way, and in riding and going, <hi>Iupiter</hi> went about his enchauntments, and ſped
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:7118:101"/>
him ſo, that he arriued in an euening at the Caſtell of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciancie.</hi> When he was there arriued, he tranſfigured him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and <hi>Ganimedes,</hi> in ſuch wiſe as he had before purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and then at the ſame houre that <hi>Alcumena</hi> ſlept, and that each man was a bed, they came to the Caſtell, and ſo knocked at the gate, that they awooke the porter. The por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter came to the windowe, and looked downe beneath, and ſawe <hi>Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Ganimedes</hi> by the moon light, him thought and ſéemed that it was <hi>Amphitrion,</hi> and his eſquire, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he opened the gate, and receyued him, in ſuch wiſe as he would haue done his Lord <hi>Amphitrion.</hi> After he brought him vnto the doore of the chamber wher <hi>Alcumena</hi> ſlept, and awooke her, ſaying that her lord was come. After he retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to kéepe the gate, by commaundement of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumena</hi> opened her Chamber vnto <hi>Iupiter,</hi> which entered in with great ioy, and at the entrie into this chamber, <hi>Iupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and <hi>Alcumena</hi> tooke each other in armes, and kiſſed, <hi>Alcumena</hi> thinking that it had béen <hi>Amphrition:</hi> and when they were ſo beclipt eache in others armes, <hi>Alcumena</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded him from whence he came? <hi>Iupiter</hi> anſwered and ſayde, he came from <hi>Thellepolys:</hi> and that after the giuing ouer of the towne, &amp; yéelding of their enemies, he departed from the hoſt, for the loue of her, accompanied onely with his eſquier, to come haſtily to her. Then <hi>Alcumena</hi> was wel content at the wordes of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and aſked him, if hee would eate or drinke? <hi>Iupiter</hi> anſwered, that he would no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but go to bed with her. What ſhall I ſay more? hee lay with her, and had that he deſired: the King <hi>Iupiter</hi> had neuer ſo great ioy in himſelfe. And going to bedward, he had <hi>Ganimedes,</hi> that he ſhould go to the Chamber doore, and abide there without. And ſo <hi>Ganimedes</hi> departed from the Chamber, and <hi>Iupiter</hi> approched to <hi>Alcumena,</hi> with great loue, and ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaiſed her in loue as much as his power might extend. In this wiſe, and by this faſhion, came <hi>Iupiter</hi> vnto the ſecrets and ioy of loue, ſo that to acquaynt himſelfe with this lady, him ſéemed expedient for to enchant
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:7118:102"/>
all them that dwell in the place. And then he ſlept with <hi>Alcumena,</hi> and after he aroſe, and came to <hi>Ganimedes</hi> which kept the watch at the doore, and tolde him, that for to do this matter ſecretly he muſt enchant all them of that place, in ſuch wiſe that they ſhould not awake vntill the comming of <hi>Amphitrion.</hi> And he willed that he ſhould go to the gate, to waite if Amphitrion came. And if it happen (he ſaid) that he came by the day light, I ſhall deliuer to you a powder that ye ſhall caſt in the ayre agaynſt him, and this powder hath ſuch vertue, that it ſhall kéepe <hi>Amphitrion</hi> from appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching this place as long as the day endureth. And then when it is night, and he knocke at the gate, ye ſhall come to me, and wee will open the gate, and bring him to his wife, and after that we will returne from hence,</p>
                     <p>The King <hi>Iupiter,</hi> with theſe wordes wrought in his ſcience, and made his charmes and ſorceries, in ſuch wiſe, that all they that were in the place might not awake with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a remedie agaynſt his inchantment. When hee had ſo done, hee tranſformed <hi>Ganimedes,</hi> into the likeneſſe of a Porter, and appoynted him to kéepe the gate. After hee returned into the Chamber of <hi>Alcumena,</hi> and ſhut faſt the windowes that no light might come in. And after he went to bed, and lay with the Ladie, and awooke her, and there ſpent all the reſidue of the night, and all the day following, taking his pleaſure with her, ſo long that he begate on her a right fayre ſonne, conceyued vnder the raigne of the beſt conſtellation of heauen. In the ende when king <hi>Iupiter</hi> had béene with her a night and a day, about the houre when the Sunne goeth downe into the Weſt, and that him ſéemed that <hi>Amphitrion</hi> ſhould come, he made by his ſcience <hi>Alcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena</hi> for to ſléepe. After he roſe vp, and made himſelfe in the form of one of the ſeruants of the place, and he had not long taried after, but <hi>Amphitrion</hi> and his eſquire came knocking at the gate, for it was then night. When <hi>Ganimedes</hi> heard him knocke, he came to the gate, and opened it. <hi>Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trion</hi> wéend that it had béen his porter: ſo he ſaluted him, and
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:7118:102"/>
demaunded him where his wife was? The valiant porter ſaid to him, that ſhe ſlept, and ſo brought him into her cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: and <hi>Iupiter</hi> ſo going, charmed him that he had no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to eate, nor to drinke. When he was come into the Chamber, he awooke <hi>Alcumena,</hi> that was all abaſhed when ſhe ſawe <hi>Amphitrion,</hi> for ſhe ſuppoſed for truth, that ſhée had ſéene him a good while before, and ſhe groped about her in the bed, and thought ſhe had dreamed. And when ſhée had groped in the bed, and that ſhe found no perſon there, then ſhe was more amazed then afore. Notwithſtanding ſhe aroſe, and came to <hi>Amphitrion,</hi> ſaying to her ſelf that ſhe had ſuppoſed to haue ſéene him before: notwithſtanding ſhee made chéere to her huſband, ſaying to him that ſhée had all the night dreamed of his comming. After they talked of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things. Finally, he went to bed with her, and lay with her that ſame houre, and then <hi>Alcumena</hi> conceyued yet a ſonne of <hi>Amphitrion. Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Ganimedes</hi> departed then from the Caſtell, and there left all ſléeping that were within the place, that none awooke till it was in the morning, and they had weend that they had ſlept but one night, but they ſlept a day and two nights. And this matter was handled ſo ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, that neuer perſon could eſpie it. By this meane the faire <hi>Alcumena</hi> conceiued two ſonnes, the one of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and the other of <hi>Amphitrion.</hi>

                     <p>By ſpace of tyme the fruits of her wombe beganne to appeare: the tydings were borne all about, and alſo into <hi>Crete,</hi> and came to the eares of King <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and Quéene <hi>Iuno.</hi> The King <hi>Iupiter</hi> this hearing, was paſſing ioyous and glad in the preſence of Quéene <hi>Iuno.</hi> Hée behelde <hi>Ganimedes,</hi> and beganne to waxe redde, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhewed a right good countenaunce, and gaue prayſes to the goddes, for the conception of <hi>Alcumena,</hi> and ſpake much good of her, ſo that the iealouſie of thys olde Quéene, renewed and refreſhed, and ſhée planted in her heart, a right great enu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <pb n="188" facs="tcp:7118:103"/>With the renewing of this enuie, the Quéene <hi>Iuno</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in her minde that was medled with the multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of ieloſie, that ſhée would ſlea and cauſe to die <hi>Alcume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> by enchauntment of ſorcerie: For in that craft ſhe was an experienced miſtreſſe. O olde curſed woman? Shée held muſing in her heart her curſed ielous thought, and laide her eares to heare <hi>Iupiter</hi> ſpeake of <hi>Alcumena,</hi> without any thing replying againe.</p>
                     <p>But finally, when ſhe knew that the time of childing of <hi>Alcumena</hi> approched, ſhe departed from <hi>Crete</hi> ſecretly al alone, and ſaide to <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and did him to vnderſtand, that ſhée would go diſguiſed on certaine ſecret pilgrimages, and went forth vnto <hi>Arciancie,</hi> where was a temple ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding right nigh the caſtle, and was made in remembrance of the goddeſſe <hi>Diana.</hi> This olde quéene then entred into this Temple, nothing for deuotion that was in her, but for to eſpie if any perſon came from the caſtle, for to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the ſtate of <hi>Alcumena.</hi> Shée was diſfigured by her craft. This craft vſed afterward <hi>Simon Magus</hi> in the time of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> and of the Emperour <hi>Nero.</hi> When ſhe had béene there a little, <hi>Galantis</hi> that gouerned <hi>Alcumena,</hi> was there long in oriſons, and prayers before the repreſentation of the goddeſſe. At the end, when ſhe had done, ſhe aroſe from her contemplation, and thought to haue returned. But this old quéene came againſt her, and ſaluted her, and for to come vnto her purpoſe, ſhée ſayd vnto her faintly: dame I am all abaſhed. Wherefore anſwered <hi>Galantis?</hi> For as much (ſaide ſhee) as I am not in certaine where I am. Loue (ſaide <hi>Galantis</hi>) ye bee at the Caſtle of <hi>Arciancie,</hi> for this Temple is of the appertenances of the Caſtle, and ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth betwéene <hi>Thebes</hi> and <hi>Athens.</hi> Dame (ſayde the olde <hi>Iuno</hi>) I trow that this is the place, that <hi>Amphitrion</hi> and Dame <hi>Alcumena</hi> dwell in? Ye ſay truth, ſayde <hi>Galan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> and howe fare they (ſayde <hi>Iuno?</hi>) Right well (ſayde <hi>Galantis</hi>) my Lorde <hi>Amphitrion</hi> is in good health, and my Ladye <hi>Alcumena</hi> is readie to bring foorth a childe,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:7118:103"/>
ſhée expecteth nor waiteth for longer day nor tearme, and therefore I may no longer tarie: it is time that I returne to her. To the gods I commit you.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Galantis</hi> with this word went to <hi>Alcumena,</hi> which began to trauaile and féele the paine of childing, and the falſe olde queen abode in the temple, in intention to cauſe to die and ſlay <hi>Alcumena,</hi> in ſuch wiſe as ſhe had purpoſed. Then, in ſtéede of ſaying of oriſons, ſhe began to make certaine fiend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and diueliſh works. This done, ſhe laide her legges to croſſe one ouer the other, and ſate in that wiſe, and then the ſame moment and time that ſhée had ſo doone, <hi>Alcumena</hi> by the ſtrength of ſorcerie began in the ſame wiſe, her legges to croſſe one ouer the other, and ſate in the ſame maner as the olde <hi>Iuno</hi> did. In ſuch wiſe, as there was no man nor wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that might make her do otherwiſe. The poore <hi>Alcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena</hi> felt then the moſt gréeuous and ſharpe paines of the world, for her fruit would come out, and it might not in no wiſe, for as much as her legges and thighs were ſo croſſe one ouer the other: ſhe cried and complained pittiouſly, and was in right gréeuous martirdome. The midwiues coulde finde no remedie: ſhée was thrée dayes holden in this point, alway her legges croſſed one ouer another. During theſe thrée dayes, <hi>Galantis</hi> and the ladies and women, one after another came to the temple of <hi>Diana,</hi> for to pray for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance of <hi>Alcumena,</hi> and alway they found the old queen ſit with her legges croſſed, and one ouer another. But they found her neuer in one ſemblance and likeneſſe. For at each time ſhe tranſformed her into diuers likeneſſes and figures, of beaſts or of women, to the ende that they ſhould not perceiue her, nor her craft. Neuertheleſſe, ſhe could not ſo tranſforme her ſelfe, but that <hi>Galantis</hi> that oft came into the temple, tooke héede of her, which found alway there a beaſt or a woman, ſit in the maner that <hi>Alcumena</hi> ſate in her chamber. <hi>Alcumena</hi> had béene then thrée dayes in paine. At the fourth day, then <hi>Galantis</hi> waxed melancholie and angry at that ſhée ſawe in the temple: ſo ſhee aſſembled the women,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:7118:104"/>
and ſaid to them. Certainly faire dames, it muſt néedes be that the paine that my lady <hi>Alcumena</hi> ſuffereth, commeth of ſome ſorcerie and witchcraft, for al the paine that ſhe hath commeth of that, that ſhee may not depart her legs and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folde them. This is mine imagination, and I am of aduice to puruey ſoone for it: For I haue ſéene in the Temple, at all times that I haue béene there, more then thrée daies, a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man or a beaſt, with legges croſſed or folden, as my Ladie hath hers: me ſeemeth for truth, that it is ſome euill crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which willeth euill will to my Ladie, and that by her ſorceryes, conſtraineth her to ſit as ſhe doth. If it be ſo, I will deceiue her: For one of you and I will go into the Temple, fayning right ioyous and glad chéere, and will thanke the goddeſſe <hi>Diana,</hi> ſaying all on high, that my Lady is deliuered of a faire ſon. And then when that creature that alway is there, and changeth her into diuerſe formes, haue heard our prayſing, if it be ſo that ſhe will any ill to my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, I doubt not but ſhe ſhall looſe countenance, and that all troubled ſhee ſhall depart, thinking to haue fayled of her enchauntment. And then if it be truth that I ſuppoſe, my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die may haue ſome maner of deliuerance from her paine. &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The women during theſe words, remembred them that they had ſéene in the Temple, the woman and beaſts that <hi>Galantis</hi> ſpake of, and were of opinion, that <hi>Galantis</hi> ſhould do like as ſhe had ſuppoſed. Then <hi>Galantis</hi> and one of the women departed from the chamber, and went to the temple, and entring therein, they ſawe on the one ſide where the falſe old quéen ſate, as ſhe was wont to do, and had tranſfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med herſelfe into the guiſe and forme of a Cow. They paſſed foorth by confidently, without making any ſhewe of ſorrow, or other thing, ſaue onely of ioy: and when they were come before the alter, they knéeled downe and ioyned their hands together, and ſayde: <hi>Diana,</hi> ſoueraigne goddeſſe, thy name bee praiſed in heauen and in earth, for thou haſt giuen this houre to my Ladye <hi>Alcumena,</hi> and helped her to bring foorth into this world, the moſt, the moſt faireſt childe of
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:7118:104"/>
the worlde. With theſe words, they roſe vp and returned againe: and as they went, they ſawe the cowe ſuddenly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part out of the Temple, and ran vpon the fields, and in the ſame time and inſtance, <hi>Alcumena</hi> aroſe, and was deliuered of two fayre ſonnes, before <hi>Galantis</hi> and her fellow were come into the Chamber.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Galantis</hi> were come vnto <hi>Alcumena,</hi> and found there two fayre ſonnes which ſhe had brought forth, ſhe was full of ioy, for that ſhe had be guyled and deceyued the falſe olde <hi>Iuno.</hi> She told then vnto the Ladies, and to <hi>Alcumena,</hi> howe ſhée had ſéene the Cowe, and howe ſhée was departed from the Temple, and aſſured them that it was ſome euill perſon, and that ſhee had holde <hi>Alcumena</hi> in this daunger by ſorcerie. The Ladies ſent after to ſéeke the Cowe, but they heard neuer after tydings of her: and greatly alway they ioyed in the natiuitie of theſe two ſonnes. Of theſe twaine, the one of them was great and right fayre, and of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céeding excellencie, and the other was little and feeble. The great childe was the firſt that was borne, and was named <hi>Hercules,</hi> and the other had to name <hi>Ypecleus. Hercules</hi> (as ſome ſay) was the ſonne of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and well reſembled, and was like vnto him, and <hi>Ypecleus</hi> was the ſonne of <hi>Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trion.</hi> The tidings of this natiuitie anon ran all about, and all they that heard ſpeake thereof, made ioy and were glad thereof, ſaue only <hi>Iuno.</hi> For ſhe had neuer ioy in her heart af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that ſhe had heard in the temple, that <hi>Alcumena</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered, and had brought forth a ſonne. She departed from the temple, as is ſaid, in the forme of a Cow, deſpiſing in her heart the goddeſſe <hi>Diana,</hi> and was ſo troubled that ſhe had neither wit nor vnderſtanding, and thus ſorrowing, when ſhe was a little withdrawne from the Temple, ſhe tooke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine her own forme of a woman, and went vpon the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of <hi>Olympus,</hi> there ſhe waxed penſiue, and beganne to think what ſhe might do: after ſhe ſmote her ſelf on the breſt with her fiſt, and ſaid: what auayleth me to be borne of the royall blood of <hi>Saturne?</hi> What auaileth me my patrimonie
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:7118:105"/>
of the world of golde? what auaileth mee the diademe of <hi>Crete?</hi> &amp; what auaileth me the ſciences of the world, that I haue learned by great ſtudie and labour, when the gods be againſt and contrarie to mee in all things? The king my huſband careth not for me, nor ſetteth nought by mee, no more in mine olde daies, then he did in my youth. O what deſtiny, Fortune wilt thou neuer turne thy wheele? Shall I alway ſuffer ſtill tribulations and this paine? Certes, ſéeing thou fauoureſt me not, and that I be holde that of all my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires there is not one that may attaine to effect, all ſhame and vexation redoubleth in me, and I am ſo put in diſpayre, that my miſfortune muſt néedes be cauſe of ſhortning and leſſning the naturall courſe of my dayes. With theſe words ſhe beheld the earth, and not the heauen, &amp; pawſed a while, and after that ſaid: And am I not wel infortunate and borne in an euill houre? My craft and ſorcerie auaileth not againſt myne enemy <hi>Alcumena.</hi> I haue fayled againſt her, but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes I will prooue my ſelfe againſt her ſonne, to the ende that his mother may be my felow, and hold me company to make ſorrow. For I will ſlea her ſonne: and by this meane, for that ſhe is a woman and a mother, I ſhall giue her cauſe of anger, gréefe, and diſpleaſance.</p>
                     <p>O curſed olde Vyrago, conſpyring then againſt the poore innocent: then ſhée imagined that ſhe would take two ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents charmed and coniured, to worke the death of the ſon of her enemy, and that ſhée would ſome night put them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his chamber, to the ende that they ſhould ſtrangle him. With this concluſion, ſhee departed from the mountayne, and returned into <hi>Crete.</hi> There being, ſhe ſo laboured by her ſcience, that ſhee did aſſemble on a day ſecretly, all the ſerpents of the countrey. Shée was alone, and well vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode, and knewe this marchandiſe. When ſhe had aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled them all, ſhee choſe two of the moſt felonous, and moſt enuenimed, and put them in her lap, and bare them home, and after waited a day, when king <hi>Iupiter</hi> had gone into a farre voyage: and then, fayning that ſhee would go on
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:7118:105"/>
ſome pilgrimage, ſhe departed alone from <hi>Crete,</hi> and did ſo much, that in diſguiſed ſhape ſhe came into the Caſtle of <hi>Arciancie.</hi> The king <hi>Egeus</hi> of <hi>th ens,</hi> and the king <hi>Euriſtens</hi> of <hi>Attique</hi> were at that time come into the caſtle to make good cheere: and it was in the euening when <hi>Iuno</hi> entred. When ſhe was within, ſhée made her ſelfe inuiſible by her craft, and ſought all about to find the chamber, wherein was the ſon of <hi>Alcumena.</hi> She ſought ſo long till ſhe came to the doore of the chamber, where there was a window open. Shée went to the window, and looked in: and in the behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, ſhée ſaw two nourſes, and two ſonnes, whereof ſhe was all abaſhed, and beganne to muſe much. Thus as ſhée was penſife, <hi>Alcumena</hi> came for to ſée her ſons, and feaſted them in ſuch faſhion, that the olde <hi>Iuno</hi> perceiued and knew, that both the two were her ſonnes, whereof ſhe had great ioy. For ſhe concluded in her falſe and euill minde, that ſhe would ſtrangle both two by the Serpents, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Alcumena</hi> departed from the chamber, by the ſpace of time, and <hi>Iuno</hi> let the night waxe darke. The nourſes laide the children in their cradles to ſléepe, and they ſlept. And after they layde themſelues downe and ſlept, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a Lampe burning in their Chamber. Then when they were aſléepe, at that time that <hi>Iuno</hi> would accompliſh her worke, ſhee opened her lap, and made to leape out the two ſerpenis, charmed and enchaunted, to worke the death of the two children, and put them by an hole into the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. When they were within, they lifted vp their heads, and ſmelling the two children, made vnto them, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the firſt aſſault vnto <hi>Ypecleus,</hi> in ſuch wiſe that they ſtrangled him, and there murthered him. After the death of <hi>Ypecleus,</hi> theſe two ſerpents came vnto the cradle of <hi>Hercules,</hi> that was awake the ſame time. When the Serpents were come to the cradle, they went the one on the one ſide, and the other on the other ſide, and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on the Cradle, but this was to their euill eaſe: For as ſoone, as they came vppe, <hi>Hercules</hi> perceiued them, and
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:7118:106"/>
was afraied: becauſe they were fierce and dreadfull, he then beſtirred himſelfe, and his armes with ſuch might and force, that he brake the bonds in which he was wrapped and ſwadled, and ſo laboured that hee had his armes and his hands at large, and then when the ſerpents ranne vppon him, hee put them backe by naturall ſtrength and force many times, and fought with them with his fiſts right long: but at laſt, when <hi>Hercules</hi> ſawe that the ſerpents op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed him more and more, and ceaſſed not to aſſaile him, he tooke in each hand one, making a great crie, and held them ſo faſt and ſore, that he ſtrangled both two.</p>
                     <p>The nourſes awoke at the crie that <hi>Hercules</hi> made, and aroſe vp haſtily, and went to the cradles for to ſee their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and they found <hi>Ypecleus</hi> dead, and they found that <hi>Hercules</hi> held yet the two ſerpents in his hands. Sodainly as they ſaw that maruaile, they cried pitiouſly. With that <hi>Iuno</hi> the falſe witch and ſorcereſſe, that had ſéene all, fled her way ſore troubled and terribly angrie at that, that the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents had not wrought and atchieued her purpoſe, as well in <hi>Hercules,</hi> as they had done in <hi>Ypecleus.</hi> And <hi>Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trion</hi> with <hi>Alcumena</hi> awoke, and came into the chamber where the two nurſes were, which made ſorrowfull and pitious cries: and entring therin, they ſaw <hi>Hercules</hi> at the one ſide yet holding the Serpents, and at the other ſide they beheld <hi>Ypecleus</hi> all ſwolen with venim and dead: then déepe and gréeuous ſorrowes came and entred into the bottome of their hearts. <hi>Alcumena</hi> began to crie and wéepe by naturall pitie, and <hi>Amphitrion</hi> was al afraide. Many damoſels and other folke came to the chamber, which all were afeard to take away the Serpents, for feare of hurt: and there was none ſo hardy that durſt approch to <hi>Hercules,</hi> for the ſerpents that he held in his hands which were ſwolen with the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim. Alway <hi>Hercules</hi> made no heauie nor worſe cheere, but laughed to one and other, and was there in that caſe ſo long, that phiſitions and ſurgions came, and by their ſcience, tooke from his hands theſe venimous beaſts. When <hi>Amphitrion</hi>
                        <pb n="195" facs="tcp:7118:106"/>
ſawe <hi>Hercules</hi> deliuered from the Serpents, he recomforted <hi>Alcumena,</hi> that was nigh dead for ſorrow, and made to burne and bury <hi>Ypecleus.</hi> All they that were there had paſſing great maruaile of the power and ſtrength of <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules,</hi> that was ſo young a childe, and that he had ſoughten againſt the ſerpents, and by exceſſiue ſtrength and might had ſtrangled them.</p>
                     <p>The night paſſed in the faſhion and manner that I haue rehearſed. On the morrow betime, <hi>Amphitrion</hi> would ſhew and manifeſt this maruailous and glorious victorie, wherefore he did cauſe to take <hi>Hercules,</hi> and made him to be borne to <hi>Athens,</hi> into the temple of the god <hi>Mars,</hi> with the two ſerpents: and he in perſon went accompanied with King <hi>Euriſteus.</hi> The falſe olde witch <hi>Iuno</hi> followed a farre after in a diſſembled forme and ſhape. When <hi>Amphitrion</hi> was come into the Temple, he ſent for King <hi>Egeus,</hi> and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled the people, and after tooke <hi>Hercules,</hi> preſenting him vnto the god <hi>Mars,</hi> thanking him of the victorie that he had ſent to <hi>Hercules</hi> againſt the Serpents. After this he lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him vp, and ſhewed <hi>Hercules</hi> vnto the people, recoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and telling to them his maruaylous aduenture. And thus when <hi>Hercules</hi> was ſhewed and put into the common view and ſight of the people, and that euery man gaue him laude and prayſe: the falſe olde <hi>Iuno,</hi> being in the preaſe, with other, after that ſhe had long beholden the noble childe, that in all his members he reſembled and was like to king <hi>Iupiter,</hi> for to put <hi>Amphitrion</hi> in iealouſie of his wife, and for to make him to haue <hi>Hercules</hi> in ſuſpition, ſhée ſayds vnto them that were about her: Certes, <hi>Amphitrion</hi> is a verie foole, if he wéeneth and thinketh that <hi>Hercules</hi> is his Sonne: Beholde the members of King <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and the members of this Childe, yée ſhall finde no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference. This Childe and <hi>Iupiter,</hi> bée both of one ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blaunce, and haue like fauours and ſhape. And euerie man ſayeth, that this Childe is the Sonne of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and none other. When this olde <hi>Iuno</hi> had ſowen theſe
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:7118:107"/>
curſed words, ſhe withdrew her apart out of the preaſe, and tooke another ſhape, to the end that ſhe ſhould not be known. And then theſe words were ſowne abrode, and told forth of them that heard them in ſuch wiſe, that a great murmuring grew and aroſe touching <hi>Amphitrion.</hi> And it was reported to him, that men ſaid ſo by aduertiſement of the olde <hi>Iuno.</hi> When <hi>Amphitrion</hi> heard theſe new tidings, he beganne to behold the childe, and in the beholding him, thought verily that this childe had wholy the very ſemblance and likeneſſe of king <hi>Iupiter.</hi> And then began to enter into his heart a right great griefe &amp; ſorrow, and thus after he entred into iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie. Yet he kept ſilence, and made as good countenance as he might, and could, for to eſchew the ſlaunder. And anon, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that the people were withdrawne, he called the king <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſteus,</hi> and prayed him, that he would bring vp <hi>Hercules,</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that neuer after he would ſée him, and that he beléeued verily that he was the ſonne of <hi>Iupiter. Euriſteus</hi> comforted <hi>Amphitrion</hi> the beſt wiſe he could, meaning to haue put this iealouſie out of his minde, but he could not. What ſhall I make long rehearſall? <hi>Euriſteus</hi> enterpriſed to kéepe and nouriſh <hi>Hercules,</hi> and made him to be borne into his houſe. <hi>Amphitrion</hi> returned vnto <hi>Arciancie,</hi> where he found <hi>Alcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena</hi> ſore diſcomforted for theſe tydings which ſhée had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued: and for to excuſe herſelfe to <hi>Amphitrion,</hi> and the falſe olde Quéene <hi>Iuno,</hi> ſhée went vnto <hi>Crete.</hi> Of which matter I will ſtay nowe, and will come to ſpeake of the firſt aduentures of <hi>Hercules.</hi>

                     <head>CHAP. XXXIX. ¶How Hercules began the Olimpiades: and how he waxed amorous of Megara, the Daughter of the king of Thebes: and how he ſhewed his ſtrength in all maner of games and exerciſes.</head>
                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Heſe tidings of this firſt aduenture of <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules</hi> were anon ſpread through all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces of <hi>Grece.</hi> Some ſaid he was a baſtard and the ſonne of <hi>Iupiter:</hi> and ſo recounted <hi>Plautus</hi> in his firſt comedye, and other held that he was the very ſonne of <hi>Amphitrion,</hi> and ſo recounteth <hi>Boccace</hi> in his booke of the genealogie of goddes. But whoſe ſonne ſo euer he was, <hi>Euriſteus</hi> had him in kéeping, and did him to be nouriſhed hardly, and not tenderly, without the cittie of <hi>Attique:</hi> For the kings and the cittizens and dwellers in townes, in this time, made theyr children for to bee nouriſhed out of good townes, and made them for to lye vpon the bare earth, and naked, for to be more ſtrong, without entring into citties, vntill the time they had power, and ſtrength to exerciſe armes. <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curgus</hi> had ordeyned this lawe and many other that followe. Firſt he ordeyned that the people ſhoulde obey theyr Prince, and that the Prince ſhoulde be firme in iuſtice and liue ſoberly, and that merchauntes ſhoulde do theyr merchaundiſe, giuing one ware for an other, without anye money, and that each man ſhoulde aduenge him openly, and that a yong man ſhould haue in a yeare but one gowne, and that one man ſhoulde not be more gallant nor quaint then another, and that no man ſhoulde renew the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of wrong paſſed: and that men of armes ſhould haue no wiues, to the ende that they might be more eager and fierce,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:7118:108"/>
in the warre: and to content the fragilitie of men, he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned, that nigh the hoſtes ſhould bee certaine women common, in places called <hi>Fornices,</hi> whereof commeth forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. Theſe were the lawes that the <hi>Greekes</hi> vſed in the tyme of the beginning, and comming vp of <hi>Hercules.</hi> And for to come againe to my purpoſe: <hi>Hercules</hi> was nouriſhed in an houſe, that ſtoode in the plaine fields, and was often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes put out into the raine and winde, and lay the moſt part of that time vpon the earth, wit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>out any other bed: hée lay oftner ſo then vpon hay or dryed ſtraw. With this nouriſhment hée waxed and grew in all beautie, ſtrength, and prudence: he was humble, courteous, and gentle. All good manners beganne to grow and ſhine in him: he was ſober in eating, and in drinking: he ſlept gladly on the fields: he ſhotte and drewe the bow dayly. When the king <hi>Egeus</hi> of <hi>Athens</hi> had heard ſpeake of him, he made to be nouriſhed with him his ſonne, that was named <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeus. Hercules</hi> and <hi>Theſeus</hi> were both of one age, and loued right well togither. <hi>Theſeus</hi> was ſtrong and mightie, and a fayre childe, and hee had witte inough. But <hi>Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi> paſſed him, and ſhone as farre aboue him as the Sunne ſhineth aboue the ſtarres. When he was ſeuen yeares old, he exerciſed wraſtling, and ouerthrewe and caſt the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt and the ſtrongeſt that came to him. Not one and one at once, but fiue or ſixe, or as many as hee might ſet his hands on, and did ſo great feates of ſtrength, that out of <hi>Thebes,</hi> of <hi>Athens,</hi> and of <hi>Atticque,</hi> dayly came men, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and children, for to ſée him. The more and elder he grewe, the more enforced he his ſtrength. When hée was ten yeare olde, there might no man ſtand nor abide in his hand. At thirtéene yeares of his age, he beganne to handle and vſe armes, and of his proper motion, he thought that he would go vp vnto the mount Olympus, and there he would abide and aunſwere all maner men thither comming by the ſpace of fiftéene dayes, and to receyue them in armes, or in wraſtling, or at any other proofe or aſſay of ſtrength:
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:7118:108"/>
and for to come to the effect of this enterpriſe, he awayted a day when <hi>Euriſteus</hi> came for to ſée him, and ſayd to him. Sir, yée haue nouriſhed me vnto this tyme, like as I were your owne ſonne, if fortune were to me as contrary as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, I knowledge that I ſhould be the moſt infortunate childe that euer was borne. Some ſay that I am ſonne to <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and other ſay of <hi>Amphitrion,</hi> howbeit I haue no fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but you onely, that haue nouriſhed me with your ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce. Wherefore I yéelde vnto you as to my father, and aduertiſe you, how that I am purpoſed for to bée on the mount of Olympus, in as ſhort tyme as I well may, and there I will abide all them that thither ſhall come, fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>téene dayes fully togither: and for to deale with them at the ſpeare, at ſwoorde, at wraſtling, and at running: alway foreſéene, that it bée by your licence and leaue, and that it pleaſe you of your courteſſe to giue to him that ſhall do beſt ſome priſe, to the ende for to encourage the hearts of noble men vnto valiancie, that they might attaine to renowme. <hi>Euriſteus</hi> anſwered and ſayd: <hi>Hercules,</hi> fayre ſonne, ye can requyre mée of nothing that is honeſt and worſhipfull, but I will hée thereto agreeable. Yée bée young, and yet ye be ſtrong and puiſſaunt, and I wote well there is no man that may endure agaynſt you. Since it is ſo, that yée haue the will ſo to do, I am right well content, that ye make the proofe, and ſhewe the ſtrength of your youth: and for to effect and bring this enterpriſe vnto your credite, I will aray you as richly as if ye were my proper ſonne. My father (aunſwered <hi>Hercules</hi>) I thanke you of this grace and kindneſſe, and ſince it is ſo your pleaſure, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooueth you to chooſe a man of great vnderſtanding and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, that ſhall go vnto all the Realmes of theſe Coaſts, for to ſhewe vnto the Kings, Princes, and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, the purpoſe and enterpriſe that I haue taken in hand. Fayre ſonne (ſaid <hi>Euriſteus</hi>) ye ſay truth, ye ſhall make your letters contayning your intention, and ſend them to me, and then when I haue receyued them, I will vſe ſo good
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:7118:109"/>
diligence, that ye of reaſon ſhall be content.</p>
                     <p>After theſe ſpéeches and many other, the king <hi>Euriſteus</hi> went home, and <hi>Hercules</hi> tooke inke and parchment, and ſet him to write in letters y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> forme of a proclamation, which he made, that contained in this wiſe. Gréeting be to all kings, Princes, Knights, Gentlemen, Ladies and Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, from the eſquire vnknowne, and well fortuned. We let you haue knowledge, that the firſt day of the moneth of May next following, the eſquire vnknowne will be on the mount <hi>Olympus,</hi> for to ſhew himſelfe in habilliments conuenient vnto armes, at the pleaſure of the gods and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and for to receiue all them that be of noble houſes and name, that will and ſhall come thither to trie maiſteries in the maner that followeth. In the beginning of the firſt thrée dayes, hee will hold exerciſe of wraſtling, and he that ſhall do beſt, by the iudgement of the iudges thereto com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, ſhall win an Elephant of fine golde. The fourth day he will runne a furlong or more againſt all them that will runne, and hee that beſt runneth ſhall win a faire Courſer. At the fift and ſixt dayes, he will ſhoote with the hand bowe, firſt at the moſt ſtraight and nigh marks, and after at the moſt long marks, &amp; he that ſhooteth moſt ſtraight and nigh at ſhort marks, ſhall winne a gloue of gold: and he that is beſt at long marks, ſhall haue a bow and a ſheafe of arrowes. At the ſeauenth, he will caſt a ſtone againſt all men, and he that doth beſt thereat, ſhall haue a right good di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amond. At the eight day, and other folowing to the fiftéenth, he will exerciſe armes: and if any will prooue himſelfe one alone againſt him, he ſhal be receiued (fore ſéene that during the firſt ſix daies he ſhall come and preſent himſelfe vnto the iudges) &amp; he that ſo doth beſt, ſhall haue a rich ſword. And if it happen that they that ſhall come to this feaſt will tourney togither in maner of a battaile, in iouſting with launces or ſpeares, &amp; fighting with ſwords or baryers, the iudges ſhall ordaine captains, ſuch as ſhall ſéeme conuenient, &amp; who that beſt doth in this exerciſe or fight ſhal win a garla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of lawrel.
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:7118:109"/>
All theſe things before written, the ſaid eſquire vnknowen promiſeth to accompliſh, and prayeth vnto all noble men, Ladies, and Gentlewomen, that they will vouchſafe to come and ſée this méeting of Nobles, which ſhall be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the pleaſure of the immortall gods, who wil giue to the acceptors of this worthie chalenge, multipliance of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and encreaſing of good fortune, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Hercules</hi> had written this proclamation, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſed it, he ſent it to <hi>Euriſteus,</hi> who read it, and him ſéemed that the inuention of the authour and maker was good and right worthy to bee put in memory, and called one of his knights, and gaue him the charge and office to go publiſh this proclamation in the courts of all the kings of <hi>Greece.</hi> The knight enterpriſed with right good heart to doe the ſaid office: (and this was the firſt officer of arms that euer was) He went to <hi>Athens, Thebes, Argos, Lacedemonia, Archadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a, Perelye, Magneſie, Crete, Epheſe, Pepos, Tripoly,</hi> and <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> and all about hee publiſhed the proclamation, without declaring who hee was that ſhould kéepe the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe. They that heard ſpeake of the ſquire vnknowne, and vnderſtoode his high enterpriſe, iudged him, that this came of a noble courage, and that hee might not fayle to gette honour and fame. The knight, for to finiſh this voyage, hadde foure Monethes tearme for to accompliſh it.</p>
                     <p>During this time, <hi>Hercules</hi> diſpoſed him for to furniſh his prouiſion for the excerciſes, and ſo did the kings and noble men, for to come thither. What ſhall I make long proceſſe? When the euen before the firſt day of the exerciſe was come, the King <hi>Euriſteus</hi> brought <hi>Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi> vppon the mount <hi>Olympus,</hi> and from all parts came thither ſo many Noble men, Ladyes, and Gentlewomen, that the number might not bee eſtéemed, the Mount was full on all ſides. All this night there was great adoo, and noyſe of one and other, for to make their tents and lodges of bowes &amp; leaues, and to pitch their pauilions. And
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:7118:110"/>
it ought not to be forgotten, when the euen was come, how the knight that had publiſhed the challenge, aſſembled in a common tent all the knights that were come thither, and required them in the name and on the behalf of the Eſquire vnknowne, that they would chooſe among them, ſuch as ſhould be iudges, and giue the priſe. When the kings that were there, heard and vnderſtood the requeſt of the noble Eſquire, they thanked him, and they chooſe thrée kings to be their iudges, that is to wéete, the king of <hi>Thebes</hi> called <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> the king of <hi>Argos</hi> named <hi>Gorgophon,</hi> and the king of <hi>Myrmidon,</hi> named <hi>Eſon,</hi> which was father of <hi>Iaſon.</hi> They were wiſe and diſcréete: they enterpriſed the office with a good will. And that night they paſſed ouer with great ioy, for they aſſembled in a tent, which was made for to daunce in, and the kings with the knights yong and old went togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and thus beganne the feaſt, which endured till mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night in daunſes and ſongs.</p>
                     <p>The king <hi>Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Amphitrion</hi> were not at this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, by the counſel of king <hi>Euriſteus,</hi> which let him haue knowledge ſecretly, that <hi>Hercules</hi> was he that ſhould holde and kéepe this ſport or exerciſe, for to eſchew all words and languages, that might grow or ariſe vp, by cauſe of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuitie of <hi>Hercules:</hi> for <hi>Amphitrion</hi> on the one ſide be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeued not that he was his ſonne, and <hi>Iupiter</hi> on the other ſide ſaid, that he appertained not to him. He ſent them word therefore, that they could do no better, then not for to come to this ſolemnitie, which was a moſt ſpeciall thing, and the moſt ſtrange that euer was ſpoken of before that time. The firſt day of May, at the houre what time the ſunne caſt his heate vpon the earth, <hi>Hercules</hi> did cauſe to ſownde a trumpet, for to make the Ladies to go vp into the ſcaffolds and places appointed: and anon after they being mounted and ſet, <hi>Hercules</hi> leapt out of the tent apparelled to wraſtle, and came into the middes of the place or field, making reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence vnto the iudges, kings, and to the ladies. He was then xiiii. yeare old full accompliſhed. Anon as he had done the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:7118:110"/>
the knight that was officer of armes, made a crie and ſaid: High &amp; excellent iu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Wherefore, if there be any man that will proue and aſſaie him at wraſtling, let him come, and he ſhall be receiued.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Theſeus</hi> of <hi>Athens,</hi> at the end of this proclamation, and at the commandement of king <hi>Egeus</hi> his father, entred then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the field: he was a paſſing faire child and a gentle, at his comming he ſaluted <hi>Hercules,</hi> and ſaid to him: Maiſter of all bodily exerciſes, I am come hither, not of preſumption, but for to learne thoſe things that I haue néede of, and therefore I recommend mee vnto your grace. My Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Theſeus,</hi> anſwered <hi>Hercules,</hi> I may more learne of you, then you of me: wherefore lette vs indeuour to winne the priſe, it muſt be begunne by ſome bodie. Theſe words accompliſhed, the two noble Eſquires approched and ſeiſed each other. <hi>Theſeus</hi> employed his puiſſance, and <hi>Hercules</hi> ſuffered him to doo as much as hée would or could, without ſhewing and putting out his force and might againe to him. And ſo they ſhooke and lugged each other, but in the ende <hi>Hercules</hi> caſt <hi>Theſeus,</hi> the moſt ſoftly and fauourably that he could. Wherat the laughter was great among the ladyes and gentlewomen. <hi>Theſeus</hi> then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from the place, and went among the ladyes and Gentlewomen, praying them that they would take it in good part that he had done. Then came vnto the place, many yong ſquires of whom I know not the names, and they indeuored and trauelled all that they might for to get honor and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, but their labor profited little vnto them, in regard of getting the priſe: for <hi>Hercules</hi> caſt and foyled all them that came, and the wraſtling dured foure houres continually.
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:7118:111"/>
At the laſt, at the requeſt of the Ladies, the Iudges made the wraſtling to ceaſe for that day, becauſe that they ſawe that <hi>Hercules</hi> was young, and that hee had done a great worke, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Hercules</hi> had vnderſtoode that the Iudges had made ceaſe the wraſtling, he was right ſorrowfull, for in his wraſtling, he had a ſingular pleaſure. The Iudges the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with <hi>Euſteus</hi> came to him, &amp; made him do on his cloaths, and aray him. After they brought him into the common hal, where as the Ladies were dauncing and ſinging ioyouſly: and it was ſayd to him, that he muſt daunce and ſing like as other did. <hi>Hercules</hi> excuſed him much, but his excuſe might not auaile. He was ſet on to daunce in hand with <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gara,</hi> a right faire Gentlewoman, of yong age, but ſhe was right well furniſhed with wit and vnderſtanding: and ſhée was daughter of king <hi>Creon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When <hi>Hercules</hi> ſaw him in the hand of one ſo noble a Gentlewoman, hee was ſore abaſhed and aſhamed. The Gentlewoman on the other ſide was alſo ſhamefaſt, for as ſoone as ſhe had ſéene <hi>Hercules</hi> wraſtle, ſhee had ſet all her loue on him. And they wiſt none of them both what to ſay: howbeit, in ſtead of wordes, they vſed priuie and couert countenances. <hi>Hercules</hi> tooke a ſingular plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to behold and ſée the Gentlewoman, and the more néere the Gentlewoman was to <hi>Hercules,</hi> the more ſhe ſet her heart on him. What ſhall I ſay? loue in this night enforced and conſtrained them to loue each other, without ſpeaking, and their beauty was cauſe therof. Men ſhuld not haue found in all <hi>Grece</hi> two ſo faire children, nor of better qualities. They were inough beholden and looked on, and in eſpecially <hi>Hercules,</hi> for his proweſſe: and euery man maruailed of him, and of his behauiour.</p>
                     <p>By ſpace of time, then <hi>Hercules</hi> was brought from the feaſt into his tent. His tent nor the tent of the kings, and of the ladies, were not made but of branches, with leaues and herbes giuing good odour &amp; ſauour. It was not knowne how
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:7118:111"/>
to make tentes of cloath nor of ſilke then. <hi>Hercules</hi> paſſed this night, more intending to thinke on the beautie of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gara,</hi> then for to ſléepe. The day following, at houre conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient ſhe came vnto the ſport, and there were many young men ſtrong and actiue, the ſtrongeſt of all <hi>Grece,</hi> but <hi>Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> with one arme threw and caſt them, and that day and the day following he caſt and flang to the earth mo then thrée hundred, and there could not ſo many come to him but he caſt them downe, and put them to foyle, without any chaſing himſelfe ne greeuing, and at that time he gat a right great glorie and honour there. <hi>Megara</hi> oftentimes behelde him, and in likewiſe did the ladyes and gentlewomen, and many there were that ſet their loue on him. And thus he paſſed the exerciſe of wreſtling to his worſhip all thrée dayes. At the fourth day he aſſembled all them that were come thither for to run, and he made them that were moſt féeble to ryde vpon the beſt courſers that were in <hi>Grece,</hi> and after he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them the furlong or ſtade, and made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to take their waye and run, and he ran after the horſe and men, but he paſſed all them that ran, and without taking once his breath he ran the furlong, and came thereto before al the ryders, and runners: wherefore he was greatly prayſed, and had a great laude. And ſome ſay, that he ran all as ſwiftlye as a hart. Of this courſe that <hi>Hercules</hi> made, all the world wondred, and helde it for a merueilous thing, and wrote it in bookes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other things worthy to be put in memory.</p>
                     <p>At the fifth and ſixt dayes following, <hi>Hercules</hi> tooke his bowe and his arowes, and went into the place that was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned for to ſhoote in with the bowe, and the Ladyes and the gentlewomen were there. <hi>Hercules</hi> and manye other, ſhot at a moſt ſtrait, and neare the marke, but ſhot by ſhot he excéeded al the nigheſt: for he ſhot alway w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>in a little ring of gold. And as for ſhooting at a long marke, he paſſed the furtheſt in the fielde foure and twentie ſtrides: his howe was ſo great that it was the load and burthen of a man. No man could bend it but himſelfe. It was a pleaſure to ſée him,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:7118:112"/>
for he gat great praiſe and fame the two dayes, and yet gat he more the daye following, which was the ſeuenth daye of the ſports: for when it came to the caſting of the ſtone a farre, one after an other, then he caſt it, imploying his ſtrength in ſuch wiſe that he paſſed ſixe paſes further then anye man that at that time imployed himſelfe in that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe.</p>
                     <p>Then they that were come to this feaſt cried with a high voice, the Eſquire vnknowne is neither the ſonne of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phitrion,</hi> nor the ſonne of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> but he is the ſonne of the god of nature, which hath garniſhed him with double force, and redoubled it an hundred folde.: in his infancie he vanquiſhed the ſerpentes, and in hys youth he ſurmoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in wyt force and valiance all the world. Bleſſed be the wombe that conceiued hym and bare hym, for to glorify <hi>Greece:</hi> For certes the tyme ſhall come once that he ſhall be the glory of the <hi>Greekes,</hi> and their tryumphe, and wel ſhal helpe them if they haue néede.</p>
                     <p>Such were the wordes of the Kings, of the Ladyes, and of the Damoſels, of the nobles and of the valiant, each man prayſed him in his guiſe. The fayre <hi>Megara</hi> heard gladlye the commendation and prayſing that men gaue him: but yet ſhe ſawe him more gladly doo his feates and valiances, and it is no meruaile though ſhe ſawe him gladlye, and gaue her to beholde him: for in <hi>Hercules</hi> was, that was not in other: his beautie ſurmounted the meaſure and the great portion and quantitie of his force and ſtrength. What ſhall I laye? After that each man that would caſt the ſtone, hadde doone, he went into the common tente, where manye an amorous man was with his Ladye, and there he began to put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe forth a little, and his ſpeache with one and other well became him: for he had a right high and a cleare vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. <hi>Megara</hi> and <hi>Hercules</hi> in this euening oftentimes beheld each other ſecretly, &amp; their countenaunces were fixed each on other often, and then of force they chaunged colour.
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:7118:112"/>
In this chaunging of coloure, there was not a veine in them but was mooued. And by this moouing grew amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous deſires in aboundance, with déepe ſighes, which were nouriſhed in the abiſmes and bottomes of their heartes.</p>
                     <p>Among al other things, for to ſpéede the matter, the kings and the auncient knightes aſſembled them in councell, for aſmuch as they had manye yong knightes that were come, and had abidden from the beginning of the feaſt, for to do feats of armes againſt <hi>Hercules.</hi> The puiſſance and ſtrength of <hi>Hercules</hi> was well conſidered of in this councell: and for aſmuch as it was verye likelye that no man might ſtand againſt him, it was ordeyned that he ſhould do no déedes of armes hand to hand: and that the dayes that were yet to come of the reſidue of the feaſt from two dayes to two dayes, they ſhould turnoy in manner of battaile: whereof ſhould be captaines two Kings that were there, that is to wit <hi>Tandarus</hi> that was father of <hi>Menelaus</hi> huſband of the fayre <hi>Helene,</hi> and <hi>Ixion</hi> that was King of <hi>Theſſaly.</hi> Theſe two Kings tooke on them with a good will this charge, and it was ordeyned, that <hi>Hercules</hi> ſhoulde lette them tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noye vntill the tyme, that the one partie were at worſe, and that then he might helpe that partie ſo ſuffring the worſe, vnto the time that he had brought the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to match their betters. This ordinance was ſhewed in the tent, by the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer of armes. What ſhall I make long counte? they that were afore named for to fight, and to doo deedes of armes man for man againſt <hi>Hercules,</hi> were right ioyous of the new ordinaunce. The feaſt then ceaſed, and one and other with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drewe them vnto their tents on the morning they came to the fieldes for to begin the firſt turnoy, and there were fiue hundred Eſquires, and three hundred knights, all armed as for to go into battaile, ſauing that their ſwordes were rebe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and not ſharpe, and that theyr ſpeares had rochettes o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

with boſſed curets, and ranne in the moſt hardeſt place of this aſſembly. There were no more but an hundred knights on horſeback, for horſes at that time were but little knowne nor vſed. All they on horſebacke and they on foote were par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into two companies. The one of theſe companies, was deliuered to <hi>Tandarus,</hi> and the other to <hi>Ixion.</hi> And when <hi>Tandarus</hi> and <hi>Ixion</hi> had all that they ought to haue, they that had horſes, at the ſound of the trumpet were readie to iouſt, and ranne one againſt another, ſo couragiouſly, that they troubled all the aire with duſt and pouder that roſe by their horſe feete. At the bickering each met with other often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and there were ſome ouerthrowne vnder the horſe, and tumbled vpſide downe at ioyning: and ſome there were that brake their ſpears knightly and cheualrouſly, for there were plentie of valiant knights. But in the end, when the knights on horſebacke had done their indeuours, and that they ſet their handes on their ſwords, the pietons or foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men began to renew the turnoye, with ſo great a ſtirre and noyſe, that all the mount redounded, on the one ſide, and on the other: there were many ſpeares broken, and ſhields vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iointed, they foyned with their ſpeares eagerly, their ſtrokes and foines were great: each man ſhewed the quantitie of his force, it was ioyous to ſée the ſpeares flie in the aire by péeces: there were great cries, none ſpared other, ancient nor yong. The ancient beate and fought with the yong: the yong men by great courage learned and ſhewed the olde men. When theyr ſpeares were broken they tooke their ſwords, where with began a new adoe, ioyous and pleaſant: they cutting their helmes and hewing on their ſhieldes ſo couragiouſly, and in ſpeciall they of the part of <hi>Ixion,</hi> that they of the part of king <hi>Tandarus,</hi> were conſtrained to call for <hi>Hercules</hi> vnto the reſkew.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Hercules</hi> heard that they cryed after him, hee was paſſing ioyous, for it was a gréefe to him to be idle, and to ſée other labour. He was nigh by the turnoye, beholding them that did beſt: he had alſo his ſword in his fiſt. At the crie
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:7118:113"/>
that they that were put to the worſe made, he went vnto their ayde and helpe, and began to turney on the ſide where were the greateſt ſtrokes giuen, ſo pleaſantly that it was ioy to beholde. The king <hi>Ixion</hi> came againſt him for to maintaine his proweſſe, and to holde togither his folke. But certes, for his welcome, <hi>Hercules</hi> ſmote him on the ſhéeld, in ſuch wiſe, that all aſtonied he bare him to the earth, and downe from his horſe. Then began there a great ſhoute and laughter, &amp; as well one as the other began to apply them to the reſkue of <hi>Ixion. Hercules</hi> put himſelfe into the preaſe, and made heapes on all ſides, ſo great, that <hi>Tandarus</hi> and his folke recouered, and entered into the battaile with their counterpartie. At that time began again the turnoy ſtrong and ſharpe: they that right now fled, tooke heart, force and vertue to them againe by the well dooing of <hi>Hercules,</hi> and recouered vigour and ſtrength. <hi>Hercules,</hi> of all them that were there was taken héed of, his ſtrokes ſurmounted all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without all meaſure, &amp; he brought againe <hi>Tandarus</hi> to match his better with little labour. Finally, he did ſhewe ſo great pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

What ſhall I make long proceſſe of the turnoy, and of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant ſports of this feaſt? There were thrée great turnoyes and notable: at each turnoy, as ſoone as it happened that one party was put backe, and to the worſe, <hi>Hercules</hi> by his well doing recouered them, and put them vp aboue againe. No man tooke héed but to his glory: euery man ſaid well of him: at daunces, and at feaſts, euery man loued him, euery man worſhipped him: there was no tongue of noble, nor of baſe, but that gaue him laude and praiſe, whereof the concluſion was ſuch, that all the priſes abode with him, and alſo there were giuen to him many gifts of the kings that were there. The dayes of this ſolemnitie drew ouer, &amp; the laſt night, the kings and the ladies, and nobles aſſembled in the common tent, and of one common accord they would that from yeare to yeare they and their heires ſhould hold &amp; renue the feaſt

When the King <hi>Euri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteus</hi> heard theſe tydings, he ſent anon to fetch theſe ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to him, and aſked them from whence they were? they
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:7118:114"/>
anſwered him, that they were of the Weſt, and of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of <hi>Heſperie.</hi> Where is the region of <hi>Heſperie,</hi> ſayd <hi>Euriſteus,</hi> and what maner Countrey is it? Verily aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered one of them, I trowe that in all the worlde is no better Countrey, for there is aboundance of all things that bée neceſſarie to mans life, and I can tell to you, that in the places of our dwelling, and where we haue our haunt, there bée manie Iles lying about the furtheſt partes of <hi>Mauree,</hi> beyond <hi>Ampoleſie,</hi> where growe all the beſt things that men can thinke, and there is a king named <hi>Philotes,</hi> ſonne in lawe to a King named <hi>Athlas,</hi> which be the generation of <hi>Greekes:</hi> and it is not to be vnremem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, how that the King <hi>Philotes</hi> accompanied with the daughters of king <hi>Aihlas,</hi> found late an Ile right plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, as was his aduenture. This Ile is all plaine with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mountaine or valley, it is in ſuch wiſe as is a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, all gréene, and there be therein ſo many ſhéepe and muttons, that it is maruaile, which be kept and chéeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed there as diligently as if they were of fine Golde. Of theſe muttons that I ſpeake of, wée haue our robes and gownes made: wée and they that may haue them, muſt buy them at a great price of Golde. Wée eate the fleſh, and cloath vs with the ſkins. And know ye for certaine, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Ile is but one entrie, and he entreth not therein that would, for the King <hi>Philotes</hi> and an other Giant which be wiſe, and ſubtill, and maruaylouſly ſtrong, alway kéepe the entrie of the Ile, and alway the one waketh while the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſléepeth. Certes (ſayd <hi>Euriſteus</hi>) by that, that I vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtoode of you, the Ile that yée ſpeake of, is of great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie. This <hi>Philotes</hi> that yée make mention of: what man is this King <hi>Philotes?</hi> The ſtraunger aunſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and ſayde, that he is the moſt redoubted and dread king of the Weſt partes: hée is a Giant that by his force and ſtrength hath conquered the Ile with the ſhéepe, and hath put out them that dwelled and inhabited there before. He is ſo ſtrong, that it is but late ago, that he ſayde, if hée
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:7118:115"/>
might find a man more ſtrong and puiſſant then he is, hée would neuer after beare armes to fight in battaile, during the life of that other.</p>
                     <p>The king <hi>Egeus</hi> then gaue leaue to the ſtrangers to depart from his preſence, and commaunded that no man ſhould let them in their returning toward theyr Countrey, and they went and departed. <hi>Euriſteus</hi> abode with <hi>Egeus,</hi> and <hi>Euriſteus</hi> came to <hi>Hercules,</hi> and <hi>Theſeus,</hi> and wiſhed by a great deſire to haue of thoſe muttons, ſaying to them, that he would that it had coſt him as much Golde as a payre of muttons weigh: and that he had a Ramme, and an Ewe, for to ingender in his Countrey. In that time were no ſhéep in <hi>Greece.</hi> When <hi>Hercules</hi> had heard the deſire of King <hi>Euriſteus,</hi> ſodainly he ſayd to him. Sir, ye haue a deſire to haue a payre of muttons, appertayning to the daughters of <hi>Athlas,</hi> by the conqueſt and armes of the ſtrong Giant <hi>Philotes.</hi> I promiſe you here for truth, vpon my gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that by this day thrée wéekes, I will depart by wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or by land, for to fetch and get them: and that I will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer returne into <hi>Greece,</hi> vntill the time that I haue found the Ile, and that I ſhall oppoſe my ſelfe agaynſt the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants that kéepe it, and will aſſay if I can get the Ile from them, like as <hi>Philotes</hi> hath gotten it from other. When the king <hi>Euriſteus</hi> had vnderſtoode the enterpriſe that <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules</hi> made, he was paſſing ſorie, for he loued <hi>Hercules</hi> as much as hée had béene his owne ſon. He diſſwaded him from that enterpriſe, wéening to haue broken it: but <hi>Hercules</hi> aunſwered ſo wiſely, and ſo diſcréetly, that <hi>Euriſteus</hi> was content to ſuffer him to go vnto this aduenture, and <hi>Theſeus</hi> with him.</p>
                     <p>The renowne of this voyage was ſpred anon in all the Countrey. <hi>Egeus</hi> and <hi>Euriſteus</hi> made readie for their two ſonnes a right good Gally, and wel furniſhed it with all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner thing. The Galley and all other habiliments were all ready in good time. At the end of thrée wéekes they went to the ſea, and with them right many noble <hi>Greekes,</hi> &amp; rowed
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:7118:115"/>
ſo foorth till they came into the déepe Sea, where they ſayled and rowed many dayes, without finding of any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture to ſpeake of. For at that time the Sea was but little vſed, neyther of théeues, nor yet of marchants. What ſhall I ſay? their maiſter or pilot, in proceſſe of time brought them to <hi>Heſpery,</hi> that afterward was named <hi>Spaine,</hi> and there ſought ſo long the Ile with the ſhéepe, that at laſt they arriued there at the place. The Giant that was appointed to kéepe the entrie, and the ward of the Ile, ſlept not at that time when the Gréekes landed. He then iſſued out of his houſe, and came all armed vnto the ſtrayte paſſage, where might no man go vp but one at once, and he cryed to the Gréekes, ſaying: Sirs, what ſéeke yée here. <hi>Hercules</hi> aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered: we ſéeke the muttons that bée in this Ile, for to carrie ſome of them into <hi>Greece.</hi> The Giant aunſwered, haue ye money inough? if ye haue ſo, ye ſhall haue inough. Howe (ſayd <hi>Hercules</hi>) ſhall we not haue them otherwiſe? No, ſayd the Giant. Then ſayd <hi>Hercules,</hi> at the leaſt let vs haue them at the price that yee haue gotten them for. Howe ſaid the Giant? The King <hi>Philotes</hi> hath conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with his ſworde the Ile and the muttons. <hi>Hercules</hi> anſwered, mine intention is in likewiſe to conquere the Ile from him. If ye will defend it, haſte you: ye ſhal haue the battell againſt me, or elſe let me haue the Ile, that I may do therein in my will.</p>
                     <p>Anon as the Giant had vnderſtoode the concluſion of <hi>Hercules,</hi> he made him ready to defend the place, and blewe a great Horne that was there hanging on a tree. At ſownding of the Horne, the daughters of <hi>Athlas</hi> awaked <hi>Philotes,</hi> and tolde him that ſome were there to get the place, and that the Giant had blowen the horne. <hi>Philotes</hi> with thoſe wordes roſe vp, and found that <hi>Hercules</hi> by force had put backe his Giant, (that excepting <hi>Philotes</hi> was the moſte ſubtile man of armes in all <hi>Heſperie,</hi>) he was ſo ſore abaſhed that hée beganne to ſigh and be ſorie: but this notwithſtanding, hée had not long abode there,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:7118:116"/>
when <hi>Hercules</hi> ſmote the giant on the right ſhoulder with ſuch ſtrength and force, that the ſhield of the giant was fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len from him, and his armes all to bruiſed, and his ſword entred ſo farre into his bodie neare vnto his heart, that he ſmote him downe dead at his féete.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Philotes</hi> ſaw his giant dead: he came vnto <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules,</hi> for to defend the place, ſaying, that he would auenge his giant if he might. <hi>Hercules</hi> had great ioy, when hee ſaw <hi>Philotes</hi> come to the place, and ſaid to him: king thou art welcome, I haue now ioy in my heart, ſince I ſhall proue my ſelfe againſt thée. Men ſay, there is no ſtroke but of the maiſter: now let vs ſée how we ſhall worke together. Well and happie bee hée, that well ſhall doo and proue himſelfe. <hi>Philotes</hi> in the hearing of theſe wordes, came vnto the place, and helde a great Polaxe, with which hée ſmote ſore vppon the ſhield of <hi>Hercules,</hi> and made him to ſtagger a little. Whereat <hi>Philotes</hi> beganne to laugh, and thought to haue ſmitten againe <hi>Hercules</hi> with that Polaxe, who was aſhamed of the other ſtroke. And he then kept him well, and waited ſo, that in the ſmiting he caught it, and plucked it out of his fiſts, and caſt it into the ſea. Then was <hi>Philotes</hi> all abaſhed of the force of <hi>Hercules:</hi> and when hee had loſt his Poleaxe, hée tooke his ſword, and came for to fight with <hi>Hercules. Philotes</hi> had the aduantage, for <hi>Hercules</hi> was vnder him. They aſſayled the one the other right fiercely, and well they kept them both two. All this day they fought without ceaſing, ſo long as the day endured: the night came on that they muſt ceaſe, then they lay there both two vpon the place. They ſlept nothing, for it was no time, both two kept the watch, and they endured it well, for they were accuſtomed for to wake. Thus waking <hi>Philotes</hi> hadde many words vnto <hi>Hercules,</hi> and demanded from whence hee was: and <hi>Hercules</hi> tolde him the truth. After they ſpake of their battaile: and at the deſire and requeſt of <hi>Philotes,</hi> they promiſed each to other, that if anye of them were vanquiſhed and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:7118:116"/>
for to ſaue his life, he ſhould be holden to ſerue truly the vanquiſher all his life after, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>During theſe ſpéeches and promiſes, the day ſtarre that the Poets call <hi>Aurora,</hi> began to ariſe in his reigne. The aire was cleare and fayre, the ſtarres ſhone. At this houre <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules</hi> caſt his eyes among the ſtarres, and ſéeing there <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rora</hi> ſhine aboue all other, he began to remember his ladie. <hi>Megara</hi> ſaying. Alas, Madam where be ye now? I would it pleaſed the goddes, that ye remembred as well me, as I remember you. In truth the light of this ſame ſtarre in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flameth the amourous fire wherewith I was late ſeiſed by the adminiſtration of your beautie. Ye bee as farre ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in beautie aboue the maidens of <hi>Greece,</hi> as this <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rora</hi> ſhineth aboue all the other ſtarres, of whom the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is ſo great that no man can tell. O noble <hi>Megara,</hi> the right cleare ſtarre, your remembrance illumineth mine heart, like as this ſtarre illumineth the heauen, and mee thinketh that by this remembraunce when I come to the battell, I ſhall preuaile the better. Wherefore I promiſe you, if fortune helpe me, like as I deſire, ye ſhall haue your part of all that I ſhall conquer, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The night drew ouer, and the day began, and at the poynt of the ſunne riſing <hi>Hercules</hi> was all glad of the thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and remembrance that he had of his Ladie, and tooke his ſworde, and ſayd to <hi>Philotes:</hi> we haue pawſed long e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="216" facs="tcp:7118:117"/>
death may not be recouered by death of a man, I will doo my beſt and deuoir, to haue a new ſouldiour, and that ſhall be you, or els my ſword and fortune ſhall fayle me. Shall I ſo ſaide <hi>Hercules?</hi> and if your ſword and fortune ſhall faile you, what tidings? By my gentleneſſe ſayde <hi>Philotes,</hi> that befell me neuer. And if any ill fortune and miſaduenture run vpon me, that I muſt néedes be your ſeruaunte, let it be vpon condition, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I ſhall neuer go after into battaile at mine owne aduenture or none other during your life: neither for you, nor for other I ſhall neuer fight, but if it be my ſelfe defendaunt. Without other wordes the two champions aſſayled each other, and ſmote togither ſo ſadlye, and ſore, that the place redounded with their ſtrokes. In a little while they had their ſhields vnfaſtened by great blowes. <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> did not fayle to ſmite on <hi>Hercules:</hi> but his ſtrokes were nothing ſo great, but that <hi>Hercules</hi> might beare them well enough without greefe or ſuffering great da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage.</p>
                     <p>Thus began the battaile againe of the two Giants. <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules</hi> was as high as a giant: he was right fierce in armes, he did much to get the ſtanding, but yet he might neuer attaine to ſmyte <hi>Philotes</hi> a full ſtroke, for aſmuch as <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> was aboue on the paſſage, which conteyned well two cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites of height. When <hi>Hercules</hi> ſawe and knewe that <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotes</hi> kept his ſtanding without abaſhing or aduenturing to come downe, he thought ſubtillye that he would fayne him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe wearie, and by little and little after he began to ſmite more féeblye then he did before: after that he reculed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and ſmote from farre, as if he had fayled and béene wearye. The <hi>Greekes</hi> were affraid and wéend he might no more: and then <hi>Philotes</hi> ſprang downe from the ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, wéening to haue put him to the foyle: but then when <hi>Hercules</hi> ſawe him before him, and that one was no more hygher then an other, <hi>Hercules</hi> came to his place againe, and gaue ſo great a ſtroke to <hi>Philotes,</hi> that he made him recule and go backe more then foure foote.
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:7118:117"/>
                        <hi>Philotes</hi> was then all abaſhed, and repented him that hee deſcended from the ſtanding: but that was for nought, for the repenting might not auaile. Then he tooke courage, and enhaunced his ſworde, and ſmote <hi>Hercules</hi> on the left arme, ſo hard that he gaue him a wound that the bloud ſprang out.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Hercules</hi> ſawe the armes of <hi>Philotes</hi> beſprinck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with his bloud, he made none other countenaunce, but that he would ſodainly be auenged of the ſtroke. In giuing to <hi>Philotes</hi> thrée ſtrokes, with the firſt he brake his helme, and ſmote him on the head, and with the ſeconde he gaue him a great wound on the right ſhoulder, and with the third ſtroke, he made his ſword to flie out of his fiſtes: and then he caught him in his armes, and after long wraſtling he caſt him to the earth, in ſuch wiſe that <hi>Philotes</hi> yéelded him ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunte vnto <hi>Hercules,</hi> and promyſed him to ſerue him trulye all the reſidue of his lyfe, and that he would beare his armes after him in all places where he ſhould go. <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules</hi> receyued to mercy <hi>Philotes.</hi> And then called <hi>Theſeus</hi> and his companye, who came and were right glad and ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of the victorye that he had obtained. Then <hi>Hercules, Philotes</hi> and all the other wente into the yle where they founde the daughters of <hi>Athlas</hi> greatlye diſcomforted for the death of the giant. And for as much as <hi>Hercules</hi> hadde alſo conquered <hi>Philotes</hi> their kéeper, <hi>Hercules</hi> and <hi>Philotes</hi> comforted the daughters the beſt wiſe they coulde: and there the <hi>Greekes</hi> refreſhed themſelues the ſpace of three dayes.</p>
                     <p>The fourth daye he tooke xxx. rammes and xxx. ewes, and brought them into their ſhip, after that they went to the ſea, without any harme doing in the Ile, for the loue of the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle women: they departed thence, and went to the ſea, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyed with <hi>Philotes,</hi> which was conquered by <hi>Hercules,</hi> as is ſayd, and after loued <hi>Hercules</hi> well and truly &amp; ſerued him euer after.

                     <head>CHAP. XLI. ¶How Hercules fought at the Porte of Troy againſt a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, of the ſea, for the daughter of king Laomedon.</head>
                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N that time, as <hi>Boccace</hi> rehearſeth in his genealogie of goodes, in the third chapter of the ſixt booke, <hi>Laomedon</hi> the King of <hi>Troy</hi> was buſie to wall and fortifie his cittie with walles and towers, to the end to make it more ſtrong. He was not well furniſhed with treaſures nor w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> money. For to accompliſhe his deſire, he went vnto the temple of the gods of the ſunne and of the ſea, that were paſſing rich, and tooke all the money that he could find, promiſing to pay it againe all at a certayne day and time ſet. By the meane of this money, he cloſed and fortified the citie of <hi>Troye</hi> with walles and towers. The worke was coſtlye, howbeit in litle time he finiſhed it: and it was not long after that the worke was finiſhed, but the day came, in which <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omedon</hi> ſhould paye and render vnto the temples of the gods the money that he had taken and borowed, At which day, the préeſtes of the temples came vnto <hi>Laomedon</hi> and demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him, if he would tender the oblations and offrings, that he had taken out of the temple? <hi>Laomedon</hi> daigned not to ſpeake to the préeſtes, but ſent them word ſhamefully, that they ſhould returne and kéepe their temples. Wherefore he was afterward ſore puniſhed, for in the ſame night after that he would not heare the prieſtes, the great windes began to ryſe and beate the one againſt the other, and cauſed the ſea to riſe in ſuch wiſe that it entred and went into the towne ſo far
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:7118:118"/>
that it helde the ſtréetes full of water, and drowned a great part of the towne. Beſides this, in eight dayes following, the ſunne ſhone ſo ardently, and gaue ſo great heate, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple durſt not go into the ayre by day time, and that dried the ſuperfluity of the abou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dance of the water of the ſea that was left: whereof roſe a corrupt and a mortal vapour, that infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all the citie. Whereof engendred ſo great a peſtilence, that the moſt parte of the <hi>Troyans</hi> were ſmitten to death by the great influence of the corrupt ayre.</p>
                     <p>By this peſtilence they of <hi>Troy</hi> fell in great deſolation, the Cittizens men and women, young and olde dyed (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpeaking) ſodainlye. The father could not, nor might not helpe his childe in neceſſitie, nor the childe the father. At this time reigned in <hi>Troy</hi> neither loue nor cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie: for each man that might ſaue himſelfe fled awaye for feare of this mortalitye, and gaue ouer, and left the Cittie, and went to dwell in the fieldes, and among all other, the king <hi>Laomedon</hi> ſéeing the deſtruction of his realme, went into the Ile of <hi>Delphos,</hi> vnto the temple of the god <hi>Apollo,</hi> for to haue the councell of the god, touching the health of his Cittie. With <hi>Laomedon</hi> went the moſt noble and the moſt puiſſant men of <hi>Troye:</hi> when they were come into the temple, they put them in contemplation and deuotion before the idol, and the diuell that was therein aunſwered them and ſayd. The money which was taken out of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and not rendred and payde againe, is cauſe of the maladie and vengeaunce of <hi>Troye.</hi> And I doo all the <hi>Troi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> to wit, that neuer ſhall <hi>Troye</hi> be quit of this maladye, vnto the time that the ſayd citie prouide to appeaſe the gods, in this wiſe: that it is to wit, that euerye moneth they muſt chooſe one of the virgins and maydens, which muſt bée ſet on the ſea ſide, for to be deuoured by a monſter y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the gods ſhall ſende thither: and the ſayde virgin ſhalbe choſen by lot or aduenture. And in this wiſe muſt the cittie do, for to appeaſe the goddes perpetually vntill the time that they finde one man, that by his armes and by his might
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:7118:119"/>
ſhall ouercome the ſaid monſter.</p>
                     <p>After theſe wordes and anſweres, <hi>Laomedon</hi> and the <hi>Troyans</hi> aſſembled to counſell vpon this matter, and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that for the common weale and health of <hi>Troy,</hi> they would put their virgins in that ieopardie and aduenture, to the ſpoyling of the monſter, without any exception or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing. Then they returned vnto <hi>Troy,</hi> and tooke their virgins, and caſt lots among them: and on her that the lot fell, ſhée was taken and brought to the ſea ſide, and anon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was ſéene to come out of the déepes or ſwallow of the ſea, ſo great a tempeſt, that the ſea roſe and was troubled. The ſea wrought and a right great floud of water lifted vp the monſter by times out of the ſea: hee was as great as a whale or a hulk, and then he tooke the virgin, and ſwalowed her in, and went away againe into the ſea, and from thence forth the peſtilence ceaſed. Thus was <hi>Troy</hi> deliuered from their ſicknes and maladie by the oblation of their virgins, that were offered vnto the monſter, from moneth to moneth: and thus (as is ſaid) their virgins were deliuered. It hapned in the end of the moneth, that the ſorte or lot fell on one of the daughters of king <hi>Laomedon,</hi> named <hi>Exiona:</hi> this daughter was yong and faire, and well beloued of all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. When this lot was fallen on her, ſhée was not onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailed and ſorrowed of king <hi>Laomedon</hi> her father, and of his ſon <hi>Pryamus,</hi> and her ſiſter <hi>Antigona,</hi> and of her cofins and allyes: but of al the people, men, women, and children: notwithſtanding, their wéepings, nor the good renoume of her, could not ſaue her, ſhee was put to the diſpoſing of the monſter. The noble virgin was ready to obey the king <hi>Laomedon,</hi> and brought héereupon to the ſea ſide, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with nobles, ladies, and gentle women, with a great traine of <hi>Troyans,</hi> citizens, and marchants, all which made ſorrow for her. What ſhall I ſay? at the inſtant that ſhe was thus brought thither, <hi>Hercules</hi> at aduenture arriued at the port of <hi>Troy,</hi> with his muttons: and hée willing to refreſh him there, made to caſt his ancres out, and going out, and
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:7118:119"/>
taking land, he beheld on the one ſide, and ſaw the <hi>Troi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> wéeping and bewailing <hi>Exiona,</hi> in caſting abroad their armes and wringing their hands, that he had pitie to ſee it. And he deſiring to know what them ailed, put himſelfe into the preaſe, and ſawe there where they bound the faire <hi>Exiona</hi> in the rout, attired with royall attire, all diſcoloured and ful of teares, as ſhée that expected nothing but the death. <hi>Hercules</hi> mooued with compaſſion to the damoſell, adreſſed his language vnto king <hi>Laomedon,</hi> for as much as it ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that aboue all them that were in the place, hee was a man of authoritie: and demanded him, wherefore that the damoſel was there bound? <hi>Laomedon</hi> caſt his eies al be
wept on him, and was all abaſhed to ſée his greatneſſe, and his beautie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> neuertheleſſe he anſwered him, what art thou that art ſo hardie to demand me of my miſfortune, which is to all common in <hi>Troy?</hi> Sir (ſaid <hi>Hercules</hi>) I am a ſtranger, and I loue the worſhip and honour of Ladies, and there is no thing that I might do for them, but I would do it vnto my power: and for as much as I ſée this Gentlewoman thus intreated, in the fauour of all Ladies, I haue aſked of you the cauſe, and I will know it, or put my ſelfe in aduenture for to die with her. And therefore I demand yet again, what treſpaſſe or ſinne hath ſhee done, that theſe men thus binde her? My ſonne (anſwered <hi>Laomedon</hi>) I ſée well that ye hée ignorant, and know not the reaſons and the cauſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my daughter is here abandoned: there is no man but he may wel know it, for ſhe ſhall die for the ſafetie and health of <hi>Troy,</hi> and I will tell you how we be come thereto. The gods of the ſea and of the ſunne haue plagued and greeued <hi>Troy</hi> with a right great peſtilence, that tooke his beginning with a ſuperaboundance of the ſea, whereby the ſtréetes of <hi>Troy</hi> were full in euerie place of water. After this deluge and flood, the time was maruailouſly and outragiouſly hote, by the great heate of the ſunne, whereby this ſea was dried vp. Of this drineſſe or drouth engendred a vapor infected, and of this vapour inſued a peſtilence. And, for to reſiſt this
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:7118:120"/>
peſtilence, I haue béen at the oracle of the god <hi>Apollo,</hi> where I haue had anſwer, for to appeaſe the gods, and to ceaſe the peſtilence, the goddes of the ſunne and of the ſea will, that from moneth to moneth, be taken in <hi>Troy,</hi> one of the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins by ſorte or lottte, for to be expoſed and offred, in this place, vnto a monſter of the ſea. The <hi>Troyans</hi> were content to fulfil the will of the goddes, and I with them. We haue caſt our lottes vpon our virgins, whereof many be ſwalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed, and deuoured by the monſter, and now the ſort or lotte is fallen on my daughter, will ſhe or not, ſhe muſt needes obey, and appeaſe the goodes.</p>
                     <p>After her ſhall come an other, there is no remedy: and this ſhal endure vpon the virgins of <hi>Troy</hi> perpetually: for it is the deſteny that <hi>Troye</hi> ſhall neuer be quite of this right hard ſeruitude and thraldom, vntill the time that they haue found a man that alone ſhall vanquiſh and ouercome the foreſaide monſter, by his puiſſance and proweſſe: which will be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, for becauſe that it is true, that all the men of the greateſt cittie of the world, can not finde any way to van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh him, he is ſo great and dreadfull. And theſe things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, demaund me no more, my daughter ſhall dye for the common weale of the place of her natiuitie. She was borne in a good houre, when the goddes will, that by lotte, and this fortune ſhe be to them offred. Syr (anſwered <hi>Hercules</hi>) tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye I thinke vnder heauen is no citie ſo bond and thrall as yours is: howbeit, it ought to be vnderſtoode that the goddes will not ſuffer that this malediction ſhal holde and endure continually. Ye muſt liue in hope. If fortune and the goddes will do me that grace, that I might vanquiſhe and ouercome the monſter, and make <hi>Troye</hi> frée from this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitude, what reward would ye giue me? Trulye ſayde <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omedon,</hi> I thinke not that it be poſſible that ye ſhould van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhe the monſter. Who is he that will expoſe him to ſo great a follye? <hi>Hercules</hi> anſwered, vnto a valiant hearte is nothing impoſſible. If I tryumphe vpon the monſter, and ſaue thy daughter, what reward ſhall I haue? <hi>Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medon</hi>
                        <pb n="223" facs="tcp:7118:120"/>
anſwered. If thou mayſt do that thou ſayeſt, I haue two horſes the beſt that be in all the world, which I loue as well as halfe my realme, I will giue them to thée as to the beſt knight of knightes, and as to the moſt hardieſt of hardye. Sir (ſayde <hi>Hercules</hi>) it is enough to me, and it ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth mée to haue the two horſes. Let me alone with your daughter. I haue a truſt and hope that this daye I ſhall la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for the weale of <hi>Troy,</hi> and that I ſhall fraunchiſe and make free the virgins and maidens of this citie. But I pray you, if there be in your citie any great barre of yron, or of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, that ye wil ſend for to fetch it to me, for to defend me with all.</p>
                     <p>The King <hi>Laomedon,</hi> and the <hi>Troyans,</hi> were all abaſhed, when they ſawe the enterpriſe that <hi>Hercules</hi> had made: and at the wordes of <hi>Hercules,</hi> the King remembred him of a great club of yron that laye at the entrie of his pallace of <hi>Ilion,</hi> that was ſo heauie, that the ſtrongeſt man of <hi>Troye</hi> had enough to doo to lay it on his ſhoulder. He ſente for it, and preſented it to <hi>Hercules,</hi> and <hi>Hercules</hi> lifted it vp as it had béene a little glayue. <hi>Philotes</hi> and <hi>Theſeus</hi> were preſent at all theſe things. <hi>Hercules</hi> tooke leaue of them, and at the preaſe, and recommended him vnto theyr prayers, and foorth with all the Sea began to rore terribly. <hi>Laomedon</hi> and the Ladyes, and they that were there tooke leaue of <hi>Exione,</hi> and of <hi>Hercules,</hi> and recommended them vnto the mercye of the goddes, and went vpon the downes, for to ſée the ende. Thus abode <hi>Exione</hi> alone and all diſpayred vpon the grauell with <hi>Hercules:</hi> who knéeled downe on his knées vpon the grauell, turning his face vnto the Eaſt, and made his prayers vnto the God that made the monſters and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible beaſtes, requyring him that he would giue him force, ſtrength and vertue of power, for to deliuer <hi>Exione</hi> from her miſfortune of the monſter, This oryſon accompliſhed, <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules</hi> entred into a little boate, that <hi>Exione</hi> was in, and anon after, the Sea roring, more and more, grewe and aroſe in ſuch wiſe that the boate floted, and was lifted vp
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:7118:121"/>
and borne by diuers waues. After this, in great troubling of winde, when the ſea was riſen in great aboundance of waters, <hi>Hercules</hi> and the <hi>Troyans</hi> ſaw comming the great horrible and vnmeaſurable monſter, bringing with him a tempeſt ſo terrible, that it ſéemed that all the monſters of hell had béene with him. He made the waues to redouble h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deouſly, he lift him vp aboue the water, and put out his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell vnto his ſhoulders, ſo that by the ſwallowing of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſprang out of his mouth great flouds of the ſea, and mounted ſo high, that it ſéemed that it had béene a gulte that had pearſed the cloudes. For to ſay the very truth of this monſter, he was ſo horrible and fearefull, that onely for to looke and behold it, the moſt hardie and reſolute of <hi>Troy,</hi> trembled for feare as a leafe on a trée. This notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, <hi>Hercules</hi> was nothing afearde, but alway he comfor- <hi>Exiona,</hi> that fell downe as dead. Hee tooke his club, the monſter came by the boate, and caſt his moſell vnto <hi>Exiona,</hi> wéening to haue ſwallowed her in, as he had done the other virgins afore. <hi>Hercules</hi> kept her, for he ſmote him ſo vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently vppon the moſell, that hee gaue him a right great wound, ſo ſore and heauie to beare, that hee made him to go backe and recule into the bottome of the ſea. Then in the falling of the monſter into the ſea, the waues aroſe high in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the aire, whereby <hi>Hercules</hi> and <hi>Exiona</hi> were all wet with the waſhing and ſprinckling of the waues: &amp; their boat was borne with the waues vpon a bancke of ſand, where the ſea was ſo low, that the monſter might not well ſwim with his eaſe vnto them. The monſter alway ſwam after them, and comming nigh to them lifted vp his head, and in the lifting vp, there iſſued out of his throate ſo great aboundance of the water of the ſea, that the boate was full of water and ſunke, in ſuch wiſe that <hi>Hercules</hi> was in the ſea vnto the great of his thighs, and <hi>Exiona</hi> ſtoode in the water vnto the middle.</p>
                     <p>Anone as <hi>Hercules</hi> ſaw him in this caſe, he had great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure in himſelfe, more for the paine and gréefe that
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:7118:121"/>
                        <hi>Exione</hi> had, then for the dread that he himſelfe had. The king <hi>Laomedon, Theſeus,</hi> and <hi>Philotes,</hi> and all other, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed then that <hi>Hercules</hi> and the damoſell, without redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had béene deuoured of the monſter. The monſter then ſéeking his pray, leapt agaynſt <hi>Exione,</hi> with a terrible waue. <hi>Hercules</hi> had his club readie on his necke, and away<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted nothing but the monſter, deſiring to auenge him of the diſpleaſure that he had, and that he would haue done to him: he then diſcharged his club on his head ſo mightily, that the barre entred therein, and the blood ſprang out. Then was the monſter more wood vpon <hi>Hercules:</hi> ſo he ceaſed the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault of the damoſel, and aſſailed <hi>Hercules,</hi> and alway as hée lifted his head out of the water, he diſgorged vpon the vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant champion great floods of the ſea. But this notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, he could not do ſo much harme vnto <hi>Hercules,</hi> but that <hi>Hercules</hi> did much worſe to him. <hi>Hercules</hi> folowed him with his club, and made him to ſinke againe into the bottome of the ſea, by the huge weight of his ſtrokes.</p>
                     <p>The battell endured long betwéene <hi>Hercules</hi> and the monſter. If the monſter might once haue touched <hi>Hercules,</hi> he would at one mouthfull haue deuoured or ſwallowed him in. He had a wide and a great throte, out of meaſure: he made a great noyſe and cry: he was fierce in exerciſing his fury. But <hi>Hercules</hi> fought with him boyſtrouſly, and held the virgine by him: and for what thing that euer the monſter did, he could not ſo ſuddenly lift vp his head out of the water, but that with one ſtroke of his club he was dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen backe alway vnto the bottome of the ſea. What ſhall I ſay? <hi>Hercules</hi> was oft tymes in perill for to be drowned. The perill was great, and more then I can rehearſe. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune was with him and the damoſell, ſo that he fought and beate the monſter valiantly, and ſo endeuoured in ſmiting continually on his mozell and on his head, that the ſea with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew, and tooke from him the ſpirite of life, and then he all to bruſed his braine, and ſo vanquiſhed him, and ſlue him. And after when the Sea was withdrawne and farre ebbed,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:7118:122"/>
hée tooke <hi>Exiona</hi> by the hand, and brought her vpon the ditch, and deliuered her vnto her father the king <hi>Laome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi>

                        <pb n="822" facs="tcp:7118:123"/>
ſay, that they were happie that died in the time of the peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence that is paſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hercules</hi> (full of great ire) departed with theſe words, and left there the king <hi>Laomedon,</hi> that ſet little ſtore by that he had ſaid to him: for he truſted and put all his affiance in the ſtrength of the walles of his Citie, and hee thought that no man might anoy nor gréeue him. And then <hi>Hercules</hi> went againe to his ſhippe, and mounted on the ſea with his club, and his ſhéepe, and with his fellow <hi>Theſeus. Philotes</hi> held himſelfe well happie for to haue béene vanquiſhed of one ſo valiant a man as <hi>Hercules</hi> was, and he tooke on him the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for to beare his harneſſe in all places where he went. What ſhall I ſay? from <hi>Troy</hi> vnto <hi>Thebes</hi> fell nothing worthie to be put in memorie, that is of record. In the ende he arriued in <hi>Greece,</hi> and knew by ſome certain man there, that the king <hi>Euriſteus</hi> was in <hi>Thebes:</hi> whereof hee had great ioy, for he thought he ſaw the ladie <hi>Megara,</hi> which hée deeſired to ſée by great deſire. He went then vnto <hi>Thebes,</hi> where he was ſolemnly receiued of the king <hi>Creon,</hi> which had him in great good account for his valiance. One and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther came and welcomed him: he ſent his ſhéepe and mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons vnto the king <hi>Euriſteus</hi> by <hi>Philotes. Philotes</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe told and recounted, how <hi>Hercules</hi> had conquered them and him alſo, and how hée had ſlaine his giant at the paſſage. Of theſe tidings was the king <hi>Euriſteus</hi> paſſing ioyous, and ſo were all they that were there, or heard ſpeake of it. Euerie man glorified <hi>Hercules:</hi> Ladyes and Gentlewomen came and welcomed him. Among all other <hi>Megara</hi> fayled not, ſhee came to <hi>Hercules</hi> and welcomed him, and well became her to welcome and make him chéere: For, ſhée was wiſe and of good manners, and certes her comming gaue more ſolace vnto <hi>Hercules,</hi> then all the louings and prayſings that were then giuen vnto him, albeit that all the world prayſed and exalted him, for this voyage, aboue all the <hi>Greekes.</hi> And the ſhéepe were ſo deſired, that kings bought them for the weight of gold: wherefore
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:7118:123"/>
the Hiſtoriographers and Poets put this conqueſt in perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall memorie, writing among his déedes in this wiſe. <hi>Subſtulit mala aurea,</hi> that is as much to ſay, that hee bare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the muttons of gold, for as much as they were eſtéemed at priſe of the weight of gold. For <hi>Mala</hi> in Gréeke is as much to ſay as ſhéepe in Engliſh, or muttons in French, and ſo recounteth <hi>Boccace</hi> in his genealogie of gods: and ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proueth <hi>Varro,</hi> which writeth likewiſe in his Booke <hi>de Agricultura.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By this conqueſt, the name of <hi>Hercules</hi> beganne to flie in heigth and excellencie. The Poets haue fained vpon this Hiſtorie, that the daughter of <hi>Athlas</hi> had a garden kept night and day by a ſerpent waking, wherein grew Apples of gold, and that <hi>Hercules</hi> ſlewe this ſerpent, and gathered and bare away the Apples. By this garden is vnderſtood the Ile: by the ſerpent waking, the ſubtill giant commiſed to kéepe it, that alway awooke at the paſſage. And by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of gold be vnderſtood the ſhéepe, eſtéemed to the valour of the weight of fine gold. After then this preſentation made to <hi>Euriſteus</hi> of the ſhéepe or muttons, as each man maruailed of the proweſſe of <hi>Hercules, Philotes</hi> added and gaue to his ouercomer <hi>Hercules</hi> prayſes vpon prayſes, and lauds vpon lauds, and honour vpon honour: For hearing kings and princes, ladies and gentlewomen, and ſeeing that <hi>Hercules</hi> held his peace at things, whereof he might haue embraced honour and worſhip, he declared from point to poynt his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture, not credible of the monſter of <hi>Troy,</hi> and ſhewed the club wherewith he had put him to death: but after that hee rehearſed the honour and grace that he had gotten in <hi>Troy,</hi> and the wrong that <hi>Laomedon</hi> had done to him: he ſaid ſo much thereof, that they enterpriſed all to go to warre vppon the king <hi>Laomedon,</hi> for to take vengeance of the wrong that he had done to <hi>Hercules.</hi>

                        </hi> his father putatiue, began to haue him in grace, and came into <hi>Thebes</hi> to him. His mother <hi>Alcumena</hi> came alſo; and certes ſhe fayled not to haue aboundance of ioy, when ſhe might ſet her eyes to ſée her ſonne, which was ſo greatly renowmed. The noble Lady had not ſéene him in long time before ſhe ſawe him tryumphe in honour, in valiaunce and in proweſſe: annoyes, griefs, and diſpleaſures, that ſhe had for him, becauſe that he was named the ſonne of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> whereof ſhe helde her ſelfe innocent, were then all forgotten and putte in oblyuion. The feaſte was great in <hi>Thebes</hi> for the loue of <hi>Hercules:</hi> men ſpake not of any thing but of him and of his proweſſe. <hi>Creon, Euriſteus, Egeus, Amphitrion</hi> and many other, aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled them togither, and made theyr muſters and aſſemblies for to go vnto <hi>Troy.</hi> By ſpace of time theyr army was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: and then they tooke their leaue, and <hi>Hercules</hi> was made captaine of this armie. He went to the ſea accompanyed with the kings aboue ſaid, and ten thouſand men all choſen for the nonce. At the time conuenient the mariners diſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, and went to ſayle: They ſayled ſo long by theyr courſe without ſtay or letting that (yet during theyr victualles) they came on a daye into <hi>Frigie,</hi> vnto a porte of a Cittie na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:7118:124"/>
                        <hi>Laryſe</hi> being nigh to <hi>Tenadon.</hi> This cittie was of the demeane of <hi>Troy:</hi> for which cauſe the <hi>Greekes</hi> aſſayled it, and tooke it by force of armes, and after that ryfled it and tooke all that was therein. And when they had ſpoyled it, they wente to <hi>Tenadon,</hi> which was a gentlemanly Cittye: they aſſayled it, and tooke it as they did the citie of <hi>Lariſe,</hi> and they put therein the fire, and burned it, ſo that the ayre was enflamed in ſuch wiſe, that it was ſéene in <hi>Troy,</hi> how the Citie burned. The aſſault of <hi>Tenadon</hi> dured not long, for aſmuch as the <hi>Troyans</hi> were not aduertiſed of their coming. When they ſawe the ayre ſo enflamed, for to ſée from what place the flame came, they mounted and went vppon the high towres and buildings of <hi>Ilion,</hi> and looking toward <hi>Tenadon,</hi> ſawe that the Cittie was all on a fire, whereat they that ſawe it were right ſorye, and greatlye abaſhed. About this they looked into the ſea, and eſpyed then there the flote of the <hi>Greekes,</hi> whereof they were more abaſhed then they were before. And then without any longer tary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they deſcended and went down into the hall of King <hi>Laomedon,</hi> and ſayd to him: Alas Syr, what is beſt to bee doone? the <hi>Greekes</hi> come vpon vs with aright great flote: we haue ſeene them and know them. The ſtrong <hi>Hercules</hi> me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naceth you, for to deſtroy your cittie. Certes I beléeue it is he. For now, for the beginning of the feaſt, he hath burnt <hi>Tenadon,</hi> and that is it that cauſeth the ayre to be full of fire.</p>
                     <p>The King <hi>Laomedon</hi> hearing this tyding began to ſighe and taſt of the euill and treſpaſſe that hée had committed and doone againſt <hi>Hercules.</hi> This notwithſtanding, for to giue courage vnto his men, and to his ſonne <hi>Pryamus</hi> that was at that time of the age of xx. yeare, he did cauſe to ſound to Armes, and made him ready, and with his armes ſhewed a right fierce and hardy ſemblance. This doone, he armed <hi>Pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amus</hi> his ſonne, that neuer had bin in battaile before, and dubbed him knight: after hée tooke him by the hande, and iſſued out of <hi>Ilion.</hi> In iſſuing out he mette manye
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:7118:125"/>
                        <hi>Troyans,</hi> that tolde him, that at his port were landed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Greekes,</hi> that had deſtroyd <hi>Tenadon,</hi> and vnleſſe hée halted him, they woulde ſoone take lande. <hi>Laomedon</hi> with out ſpeaking any worde, paſſed foorth by them that had brought him theſe tidings, and came to a place that was there by <hi>Ilion,</hi> where he found mo then twentie thouſand <hi>Troyans</hi> ready armed. And ſéeing them, he began to ioy in himſelfe, and called the principals, &amp; ſayd to them: Lords, ye be renowned in all the world, by the high proweſſe of your aunceſtours: Before that <hi>Troy</hi> was walled, they defended it with the ſworde agaynſt their enemies: the renowmed king <hi>Iupiter</hi> of <hi>Crete,</hi> could not get this Citie, nor the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> by their warre, might neuer ſubdue this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. It is nowe happened this day, that a new aſſemblie of enemies come vpon this Citie, and as men ſay, they haue put the fire in <hi>Tenadon:</hi> let vs go receiue them couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, and let vs make of them like as our fathers haue made with other, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>When the <hi>Troyans</hi> had heard theſe wordes of theyr King, they anſwered all, that they would liue and die with him, for the weale of the Citie: and that they had intention to kéepe his honour, and for to make growe their aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent glorie. Without holding of long proceſſe, the King <hi>Laomedon</hi> did then diſplay all his banners. After he iſſued out of <hi>Troy,</hi> ſetting and trayning his men in good order. And then as he began to conduct and lead them foorth, ſodainly hée heard at the port, a paſſing great noyſe and bruite of Trumpettes, Clarions, and Tabours, of the <hi>Greekes.</hi> Then his bloud began to chafe, then his haire of his heade began to ſtande vppe, hée knewe that they were his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes: and as ſoone as they knewe the <hi>Greekes,</hi> without holding of any order nor meaſure, they diſlodged them, and began to runne to the port, one before an other. When they approched the port, they eſpyed the <hi>Greekes,</hi> that lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with great forces. Then they chalenged them vnto the death, and ran vpon them ſharpely. The <hi>Greekes</hi> were
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:7118:125"/>
furniſhed with good armours, and put them to defence, and began to ſkirmiſh the one with the other ſo vnmeaſurably, that in the aboording and méeting there were many dead and hurt. <hi>Hercules</hi> was there among the <hi>Greekes.</hi> He began to fight ſharpely among the <hi>Troyans,</hi> and had his club. Certes he welcommed them in ſuch wiſe, that the moſt ſtrongeſt of his enemies durſt not abide him: he fought fiercely, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of reuengement, in coueting of worſhip, and to get him a name. Lifting vp his hand, he ſhewed to the <hi>Troyans</hi> his club, and made them to féel the weight therof, &amp; the ſtrength of his arme, and he labored ſo earneſtly, and did ſo valiantly, that they that ſaw him, doubted him more then death, and ſayd the one vnto the other: behold <hi>Hercules,</hi> but come not néere him. It were folly ſo to do: all that he reacheth he ſlea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and breaketh to péeces. We do euill to fight againſt him: this is the deliuerer from the terrible ſeruage and thraldom of <hi>Troy:</hi> how ſhould we reſiſt his club, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the huge dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full monſters be by the ſame put to the foile? &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Such were the words of the <hi>Troyans. Hercules</hi> fought agaynſt them fiercely: he was ſtout and ſtable: he went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: all the <hi>Greekes</hi> followed him, and tooke a pleaſure to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him. The cry was great about him. What ſhall I ſay? he fought vntill the night, and neuer ceaſed vntill the going downe of the Sunne, and then the <hi>Troyans</hi> ſounded the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trait, and they departed both parties. <hi>Laomedon</hi> put his ſword into his ſheath, which was all bloody with <hi>Greekes</hi> blood: and in likewiſe did <hi>Priamus</hi> his ſon. They reentred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Citie, after the ſkirmiſh, &amp; they concluded, that on the morrow they would furniſh their enemies with battell. And the <hi>Greeks</hi> furniſhed them in the champaine, and made good cheare, for they had loſt but litle of their people at their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming on land. This night paſſed ouer: when the day appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the <hi>Troyans,</hi> and the <hi>Greekes,</hi> each in his maner made him ready to the battell: many of the <hi>Troyans</hi> would gladly haue broken this battell, and prayed vnto king <hi>Laomedon,</hi> that he would render and deliuer to <hi>Hercules</hi> the horſes that
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:7118:126"/>
he ought to him. <hi>Laomedon</hi> would not do it, but aunſwered, that he doubted nothing his enemies. He had then about fifty thouſand of fighting men, all readie: of theſe fiftie thouſand he made two battailes, one of twentie thouſand, and that he led himſelfe, and the other of thirtie thouſand, of which hée made <hi>Priamus</hi> captaine. This done, he iſſued out of <hi>Troy,</hi> with twentie thouſand fighting men, and came vnto the fields, entring vpon the <hi>Greekes,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>When the <hi>Greekes</hi> eſpied king <hi>Laomedon</hi> comming, they were full of ioy, as they that were readie for to receyue them at the point of their ſpeares, and with hewing of their ſwords. They had made of their hoſt foure battailes. In the firſt was <hi>Hercules.</hi> And in the ſecond was <hi>Amphitrion,</hi> and <hi>Theſeus.</hi> And in the third was the king <hi>Creon,</hi> and in the fourth was <hi>Euriſteus. Hercules</hi> then that had the firſt bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, marched when it was time, agaynſt the King <hi>Laome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and he had foure auncient knights well appoynted in the feates of Armes, that ſet and conducted his folke in ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray and order. They marched ſo nigh, the one to the other, with great noyſe of Trumpettes, and Labours, that the Archers, and Croſſe bowes beganne the battaile, after that that <hi>Hercules</hi> hadde ſummond <hi>Laomedon</hi> to pay him that he had promiſed him, and that <hi>Laomedon</hi> had made refuſall thereto. The <hi>Greekes</hi> were furniſhed with ſtronger Bowes and ſhotte then the <hi>Troyans</hi> were: and by that meane they ſlewe abundaunce of their enemyes: and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <hi>Hercules</hi> bare him ſo well with fortie Arrowes that hée himſelfe ſhotte, one after another, that hée ſlewe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of his enemyes, ſuch as hée would chooſe, without fayling.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hercules</hi> was at that time the beſt archer, and the moſt ſure at marke that was in all <hi>Greece,</hi> &amp; alſo in al the world. He and his men (as is ſaid) caſt many of the <hi>Troyans</hi> to the ground by the ſhot. When the ſhot fayled, <hi>Hercules</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered his bowe vnto <hi>Philotes,</hi> that bare his harneſſe, and tooke a ſtrong ſword and ſure. When it came to ſwordes,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:7118:126"/>
and breaking and foyning with ſpeares, <hi>Hercules</hi> that was alway in the firſt front, leapt againſt the king <hi>Laomedon,</hi> that was departed from his hoſte afore all other, for as much as hee rode vppon one of the horſes that hee had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to <hi>Hercules.</hi> And running one againſt the other as ſwiftly as they had flowen in the aire, met and ſmote each other ſo ſore, that their ſpeares brake in péeces, which ſprang about them. <hi>Hercules</hi> paſſed forth and ſmote among the <hi>Troyans,</hi> and <hi>Laomedon</hi> in like wiſe, entred into the hoſt of the <hi>Greeks:</hi> they beganne to handle their ſwords, and to hewe each vpon his enemies. Then aroſe there a maruailous noyſe: they that had ſpeares and ſhields, employed them for to ioyne battaile. The fight was great, the ſtrokes were hard, the battaile was generall, for of the one partie &amp; the other, many men were diſtreſſed and beaten, notwithſtanding that the <hi>Greekes</hi> were moſt boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous and moſt hard in armes, and more valiant then the <hi>Troyans,</hi> and better helde them together, then they of the battaile of king <hi>Laomedon. Hercules</hi> wrought and beſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him faſt with his ſword, that hee had conquered from <hi>Philotes.</hi> At euery ſtroke and euerie ſtep he killed a <hi>Troyan,</hi> and ſmote of their heads and armes in great aboundance, that it ſéemed that they that hee touched had not béene ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. <hi>Laomedon</hi> was buſie on the one ſide, and fained not, but bare him right well vpon his horſe, and ran from ranke to ranke among the <hi>Greekes:</hi> he reſted not, but conducted his people knightly, and his people were great in number: he ſet vppon his enimies ſo eagerly, that hee incloſed them, and then was the murther and ſlaughter ſo great that on al ſides a man ſhoulde not haue ſeene anything but bloud and heads, and armes flie in the place and the field.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Theſeus</hi> and <hi>Amphitrion</hi> beheld the battaile of <hi>Hercules</hi> ſo encloſed with the <hi>Troyans,</hi> they bethought them, and came to his help ere he had néed. At their coming they made a right great vprore, they thruſted &amp; couched their ſwords vpon the <hi>Troyans,</hi> which were too far forward, and
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:7118:127"/>
ioyned to them with ſuch proweſſe, that they ſmote downe the moſt ſtable and ſtrong, and went ſo farre among them, that they made them that were ſo farre come, to retire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and go backe by force and ſtrength. In this going backe and reculing, the hoſt of <hi>Laomedon</hi> was all afraide and abaſhed. The thrée ſwords of <hi>Hercules,</hi> of <hi>Theſeus,</hi> and <hi>Amphitrion,</hi> were ſéene brandiſhing aboue all other in wel doing, and in ſhort ſpace they began to vanquiſh and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come their enemies, and would haue brought them to the foyle &amp; ſhame. Then that the yong <hi>Pryamus</hi> with his thirty thouſand appeared to come to the aſſault, making ſo great a noyſe that al the ground trembled, and gaue a maruailous ſound, and they that were vpon the walles and edifices of <hi>Troy,</hi> made withall a great crie. <hi>Hercules, Theſeus,</hi> and <hi>Amphitrion,</hi> beholding <hi>Pryamus</hi> coming, and the puiſſance of <hi>Troy,</hi> ſet their people in aray, and in battaile order went with a great traine of <hi>Greekes</hi> againſt them, for to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand their enterpriſes. <hi>Theſeus</hi> was the firſt that ſpied <hi>Pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amus,</hi> who ſet and couched his ſpears againſt him, and he came with a great courage mounted vpon the ſecond horſe of king <hi>Laomedon</hi> his father, and charged with ſo great might vpon <hi>Theſeus,</hi> that he bare him to the ground turned vp ſide down, bruiſing him vpon his ſhield. <hi>Theſeus</hi> reléeued him being right angrie at this fall, and entred among the <hi>Troyans,</hi> ſmyting and hewing on them with his ſword, in ſuch furie, that he ſmote off the heads of more then thirtie <hi>Troyans</hi> ere hee ceaſed. The bruit and noyſe was great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him. The <hi>Troyans</hi> would haue reuenged them of his ſword, but their power was not ſo great: they had worke inough to ſaue themſelues, many <hi>Greekes</hi> came in the aide and helpe of <hi>Theſeus:</hi> and then they began to renew the battaile.</p>
                     <p>At this time, and at this ſkirmiſh <hi>Hercules</hi> and <hi>Amphitri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> were nothing idle: they were on one ſide, and <hi>Theſeus</hi> on the other: at méeting there was many a man hurt and ſlaine. <hi>Priamus</hi> did maruailes vnto the <hi>Greeks:</hi> at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:7118:127"/>
he bare him ſo valiantlye among his enemyes, that he found no man that did him any harme or annoy. He made his ſword for to taſt ſtronglye the blood of his aduerſaries: then as he was in this caſe he heard about <hi>Hercules,</hi> a right hie and a great pearſing crye of his people, crying, <hi>Troye, Troye,</hi> in diſpayre to haue preuailed. And then <hi>Pryamus</hi> wéening to haue holpen, and to ſmite downe dead all them that were before him, ran vnto the reſkew, to his maladuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: for as ſoone as he was come before <hi>Hercules,</hi> and, <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules</hi> ſawe him ſo on horſebacke, he remembred him that it was he that had ouerthrowen <hi>Theſeus</hi> to the grounde, and ſaid, that he would auenge him, and lifting vp his ſword, he ſmote <hi>Pryamus</hi> ſo fiercelye vpon his helme, that he was all aſtonied, and that his ſword ſlid down on his horſe neck, and entred in ſo farre, that there fel downe both <hi>Pryamus</hi> and the horſe.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Pryamus</hi> was ſo ouerthrowne horſe and man, and alſo ſo aſtonied, that he wiſt not where he was: <hi>Hercules</hi> was aduertiſed that it was <hi>Priamus</hi> ſonne of the king <hi>Laomedon:</hi> and then had pitie of him, and tooke him priſoner, and did ſend him out of the battaile. The <hi>Troyans</hi> ſéeing this, were ſore and grieuouſly troubled, and for the reſkew of him they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuoured themſelues and were encouraged ſo terribly, that <hi>Hercules</hi> might not ſuſtayne al the rigour of the battaile, and that the <hi>Greekes</hi> were conſtrayned to looſe place. The King <hi>Creon</hi> then diſplayed his banner, and his battaile, and in likewiſe did <hi>Euriſteus,</hi> and they put them in two winges one on the right ſide, and the other on the left ſide: and they came running in vppon the <hi>Troyans</hi> with ſo great noyſe and ſo great tempeſt, that all the <hi>Troyans</hi> felt well their coming, for at that time they wiſt not where to turne them.

                     <p>At this enterméeting, and ſkirmiſh, <hi>Laomedon</hi> was out of the preaſe and refreſhed him. When he heard ſaye that
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:7118:128"/>
his ſonne <hi>Priamus</hi> was taken: he was therefore paſſing ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull, and had ſo great paine, that the ſweat came to his heart and from thence vnto all his members, wherefore he went himſelfe againe to battell halfe out of his mind: the battell was then fell and enuenomed, and there was moſt hard fighting. But, for to augment and increaſe the ouer-great ſorrow of this <hi>Laomedon,</hi> he found that his folke had the worſe and loſſe, and litle fought, On the other ſide, hée ſaw the horions and ſtrokes of the <hi>Greekes,</hi> ſo great and ſo vnmeaſurable, that his men were brought out of ranke, and the arayes broken, and charged with ſo heauy ſtookes of the heauy ſwords, that they went and turned backe, and began to flie: and then when it came to the diſcomfiture, <hi>Laomedon</hi> abode not with the laſt, but entred againe into his Citie as haſtily as he might. The <hi>Greekes</hi> followed the <hi>Troyans</hi> ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly, and ſo nigh, that they entred in with them, with great effuſion of blood. <hi>Hercules</hi> was the firſt that wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Many <hi>Troyans</hi> paſſed by the cutting of the ſword, and many fled away by the fields, and buſhes. When <hi>Laomedon</hi> ſaw, that by force his Citie was taken, and put in the hands and gouernance of the <hi>Greekes</hi> (right ſore diſcomforted, and all in deſpaire) he tooke his daughter <hi>Exione</hi> and <hi>Antigone,</hi> and his moſt precious iewels and gemmes, and fled away priuily, thinking that his enemies woulde make there a right great deſtruction and pilling, as they did: For when <hi>Hercules</hi> had put his men within the Citie, he let his men robbe and pill. Thus the <hi>Troyans</hi> were perſecuted. The chanels were tempred with their blood. The houſes were beaten downe, and the great riches were put into prayes: and of all the goodes of the Citie, there were left nothing whole, but the pallace of <hi>Ilion,</hi> whither the ladies and the maides were withdrawne. <hi>Hercules</hi> would in no wiſe deſtroy this pallace, foraſmuch as the ladies made to him a requeſt for to ſpare it. At this priſe <hi>Hercules</hi> ſought long <hi>Laomedon</hi> in the pallace of <hi>Ilion,</hi>
                        <pb n="239" facs="tcp:7118:128"/>
and in all places of the citie, but he could heare no tydings of him, wherefore he was ſore diſpleaſant: and when he had beaten downe the walles, that had béene made with the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney of the gods, he departed thence, and returned into <hi>Grece</hi> with great glorie. And in this wiſe was <hi>Troy,</hi> deſtroyed the firſt time.

But then, as the olde Iuno by her euill and curſed enuie gaue her to imagine and thinke how ſhee might make Hercules to be deſtroyed and die, tidings came to Crete, that into the forreſt of Nemee were come many Lions, and among all other, there was one that was ſixtéene hand of height, that deſtroyed and waſted all the countrey. And this Iune had warre againſt Euriſteus, and then, for to haue acquaintance with Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, and vnder colour of good loue, for to bring him into the clawes of this lion, ſhée made peace with Euriſteus, and ſent for him to come into Crete, for to confirme the peace. Euri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteus, that thought nothing but well, went into Crete, and brought with him Hercules. The peace was made, Iuno acquainted her with Hercules, they came to ſpeake of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:7118:132"/>
in the forreſt of Nemée, &amp;c. And ſo much ſpake Iuno, and reported to them that ſhe ſaid to Hercules, that it were well an act for to get him honour and renowne, for to go vnto the forreſt of Nemée, and for to employ him to conquer thoſe lions. Hercules weening that Iuno had counſelled him for to go and aſſaile the Lions for his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and profit, enterpriſed for to go into the forreſt. Iuno required him, that if he went, when he had vanquiſhed the lions, hee would returne vnto her. Hercules promiſed her that he would ſo do. After he departed from Crete: and firſt hee went into Thebes for to ſée Megara, and for to make his harneſſe and armes for to be readie. When the ladies of Thebes knewe that Hercules would go againſt the lions of Nemée, all they complained of his youth: and they thought that hee ſhould die there, for the lions were cruell and terrible. Megara aboue all other, was paſſing ſorrowfull, and required the ladies, that they would pray Euriſteus, that he would kéepe Hercules from going vnto ſo dangerous a voyage. The ladies accompliſhed the requeſt of Megara, and had wéened to haue broken the voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of Hercules by the meane of Euriſteus, but they might in no wiſe let his purpoſe: For Hercules anſwered to Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſteus, and vnto the ladyes, that it was the firſt enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe that he had taken in hand at the requeſt of any ladye, and for as much as the quéene Iuno had made him to do it, he had intent to accompliſh it by the pleaſure of the goddes and of fortune.</p>
                     <p>Hercules was great in heart and of courage, being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted with honour, he had leuer haue dyed then to haue done a thing whereof ſhould follow any diſhonour. When his armes were readie, he armed him. After he tooke leaue of king Creon, of Euriſteus, of Amphitrion, of the ladies, and of the Gentle women, accompanied onely with Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, which would neuer leaue him. He departed from The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes, and ſo ſped him in his iourney, that hee came vnto the forreſt of Nemée, which ſtood not farre from Argos. In ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proching
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:7118:132"/>
this forreſt, he went two dayes without finding beaſts or men, vntill the time that he entring into the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, found a paſtor or heard-man named Melorcus. This heard man was mounted vppon a great trée. When that he ſawe Hercules enter into the wood, he called to him, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Syr ye be dead, if ye go any further, returne quickly, for the fierce lions will eate you: or elſe come hither vppe to me vpon this trée. Hercules hearing the words of Melor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus, looked vpon the trée, and demanded him what he was? alas ſaid the paſtor, I am the moſt poore man of all other, the lions of the forreſt at their comming haue eaten a great heard of beaſts, that I haue nouriſhed héere by: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that, they haue eaten all my familie and meinie: and they haue deuoured all ſaue me alone, which haue by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture a great while ſaued my ſelfe vpon this trée, where I eate nothing elſe but leaues and akehornes, and dare not deſcend and come downe, for feare of thrée lions which be héere by, who will ſoone aſſaile you, vnleſſe ye depart and flie, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The paſtor finiſhing his words, there came leaping out of a buſh the three lions, and marched againſt Hercules, ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and crying, and opening their eies with ſo great rage, that it ſéemed they would haue pearced through Hercules with their fell ſight. The great lion came firſt, his haire ſtanding vp, hee was as high as an Olyphant, &amp; great after that proportion, and his head was twiſe as big as the head of a bull. Hercules ſéeing them come, tooke his ſword and his clubbe that Philotes bare. Philotes, notwithſtanding his proweſſe, was ſo ſore afraide, that hee went vppon the trée vnto the heard-man. Hercules ſet his club vnto the tree, and tooke his ſword faſt in his fiſts: the lions at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praching brayed in their throates. Hercules ſmote one of them betwéene the eyes, and bare him downe to the earth, that hee ſate vppon his buttockes. The great lion thought to haue ſprong vppon Hercules, and to haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken him in his clawes, and made a terrible leape. When
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:7118:133"/>
Hercules ſawe and knewe his intent, he turned from him, and ſmote at the third lyon, which was light and nimble, and ſtrake with his ſword ſo right, and ſo firmelye into his throte, that he raught him to the hart, what-ſoeuer reſiſtance that he made in biting of the ſword: and left it within his body in ſuch wiſe that he fell downe dead. When the two lyons ſawe their felow ſo vſed they ſet their clawes on the earth, and howled ſo yrouſly, that it ſéemed that thunder had ſprong out of their ſtomacks. All the foreſt ſownded thereof. Hercules tooke his ſword: the two lyons approched of newe againe, and ran vpon him with theyr pawes, and hurte him ſo vnmeaſurably, that they looſed his armour, their nailes entring into his fleſhe, and them they drew out al dyed with his bloud.</p>
                     <p>Hercules had his heart ſore troubled, when he felte his woundes that the Lyons had made: then hee lifted vp his ſworde, and ſmote on one and other, but the great Lyon had his ſkyn ſo hard, that his ſworde might no more enter therein then it might on a great ſtithy. Thus began the battayle of the Lyons and of Hercules. The little lyon was paſſing eager and fierce, hee launched him foorth ofte times againſt Hercules, and alwaye thought to haue hurt him with his clawes that cutted like a raſour: but he laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched ſo ofte that it was to his euill health and eaſe, for Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules among, and after many ſtrokes, made to be deuided from his body the right legge, very nigh by the ſhoulder, and ſmote him downe by the féete of that other lyon that laye dead. &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>When Hercules ſawe that he was deliuered of the two euil beaſtes, and that he had no more to doo but with the great Lyon, he began to haue an hope of good fortune. He then had comfort in himſelfe of the battaile, which was ſtrong to ſuſtaine: for the great lyon gaue him great ſtrokes with his pawes, and put him oft times in perill of death: the ſword of Hercules might neuer enter into the ſkin of the beaſt, it was ſo hard. The lyon tooke his ſword betwéene his
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:7118:133"/>
téeth and his nailes, that with great paine he pulled and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it from him. Finally, when he had long fought with his ſword, and knew well that thereby he might raiſe no bloud of the lion, he would aſſay if his club were to him more profitable. Then he tooke it, and the firſt time that the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on came vpon him, hee gaue him a ſtroke with his club, ſo great on his mouth, that all the téeth brake and fell out before him. The Lion féeling the ſtroke, made a great mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailous howling, ſo he lifted vp his pawes, and thought to haue pulled downe Hercules. But he fled the comming of the lion: and the lion fell to the ground, with ſo great fierceneſſe of running and fayling of Hercules. And when Hercules ſawe that hee was fallen, he leapt vppon him forthwith eagerly and beate him, and held him with his hands about the throate, ſo faſt, that hee brought his iawes out of their places out of ioynt, and made his eies to flie out of his head and ſtrangled him, and ſo ſlew him.</p>
                     <p>In doing this déede or worke, Hercules ſhewed a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar hardines, and incredible force: for he ſtrangled with his hands a lion, with the ſkin ſo hard, that ſpeares nor ſwords might not do any harme: he put him to death by a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full valiance: and when hee had ſo done, he went to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that liued yet, and all to brake and tare him, as if it had beene a little lambe. After he called Philotes to him, and the paſtor or heard-man, that were maruailous ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and glad of ſo high a victorie. And Hercules found the maner how to flea the Lions, and tooke their ſkinnes, by the helpe of the heardman. When they had fleaed them, it was night. Hercules then demanded the heardman, if there were any houſe or lodging thereby, where hee might haue meate and drinke? The heardman brought him to his houſe, where they found prouiſion of meate and drinke, wherewith the good man feaſted Hercules to his power, and he ſéemed that he was in paradiſe. And thus Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les paſſed the day and the night, and forgat not to thinke on his wounds that were fell and ſmarted, ſo that little

This notwithſtanding, when the day appeared, he tooke leaue of the heard-man, and ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, and tooke his iourney for to go into Crete, for to ſhew vnto the Quéene Iuno the thrée lions ſkinnes, and for to thanke her of her good aduertiſement.</p>

Buſire, for to remedie this, called his Clearkes that held the ſcience of Zoroaſtes, and aſked of them what he might do for the health of his Realme? They aſked counſell of the gods, and had anſwere, that they muſt ſacrifice vnto them mans bloud. When Buſire (that naturally was euill, and that had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer done good) heard this anſwere: he beganne to tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſe more and more, that was a tyrant before. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne firſt with his people, raking and plucking from the mothers their little children, and from the men their wiues, and from the wiues their huſbands, in bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and defiling the temples of Egypt with their bloud. For all theſe homicides and ſlaughters the drouth ceaſed not, but augmented and waxed more. The Clearkes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded their goddes, the cauſe why they had no dewes of water nor raine from aboue? They anſwered, that they would not haue the iuſt bloud of Egypt, but the ſtrange blood which they ſhoulde take and make ſacrifice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. The goddes by this anſwere, would haue in ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice

the blood of Buſire, for he was ſtrange in vertuous po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie, and farre from all good. And the Clearkes vnderſtood that they would haue the blood of ſtrangers. Buſire aduerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of this anſwere, ceaſed to perſecute the blood of Egypt, and turned his ſword vpon the blood of ſtrangers. And made an Edict and ſtatute, that no ſtraunger ſhould enter into his Citie, but hée ſhould be ſacrificed to his goddes, and that hee would ſlea all the ſtraungers that he might get. By this Edict, and by this damnable cuſtome, manie ſtraungers, nobles and other were put to ſacrifice, and had their blood ſhe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The tydings came into Crete, and there was made for him a great ſorrowe. As this ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe was in his moſt prime, Hercules and Philotes came vnto the Quéene Iuno, and they found her charged with teares of wéeping, in her Citie. At that tyme there were an hundred Cities in Crete, and the King Iupiter helde him no more with Iuno, for many cauſes and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, When then Hercules was returned vnto thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The curſed ſtepmother, for the returne of Hercules, augmenting her ſorrow vpon new ſorrow, receiued and fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted Hercules, and made to him faintly the greateſt cheare that ſhe could.

In eating, after diuerſe ſpeaches of the Lions, ſhe deuiſed and thought howe ſhée might make Hercules for to die: and thought ſhe might do no better, then to ſend him into Egypt. At that tyme ſhe concluded in her ſelfe, that ſhe would ſend him into Egypt if ſhe might. For to do ſo, ſhe changed the reaſoning of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſayd to Hercules: your coming again in ſafetie, is to mee moſt ioyfull, for that your name ſhall bée put in

On the morrow he took leave of his Step-mother, and departed from <hi>Creet,</hi> ſo journeyed on the way with <hi>Philotes,</hi> (without finding any adventure, worthy the remembrance) on a day he came to the Gate of the City <hi>Memphis,</hi> in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> where the Tyrant <hi>Buſire</hi> held his reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>

He ſlew many of them, and the remnant he made to flye. His ſtrokes were ſo forcible, that the Complices of <hi>Buſire</hi> that were accuſtomed to ſhed mans blood, had their blood ſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and could not remedy their miſ chance, which was ſo great, that <hi>Hercules</hi> filled all the place with dead bodies. And after a long battel, he found himſelf alone, for there was no man ſo hardy that durſt be ſéen before him. The people and the Commonalty of the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> minded not the reſcue of their King. When they ſaw him beaten, they all hated him, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the Battel from far by very great routs. When <hi>Hercules</hi> had then laboured ſo much, that he found no man to fight with him, he ſet down his Club, and addreſſed him unto a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of <hi>Aegyptians</hi> that ſtood there, and aſſured them, he would do nothing unto them, and asked what people they were that had aſſailed him? They anſwered him knéeling on their knees, they were Man-ſlayers, Hang-men, and people of vicious and evil life: that their King, which he had firſt beaten down, was the worſt of them all, and had purpoſed to put him to death as a ſtranger, to make Sacrifice unto the Gods. And they prayed him to Sacrifice their ſaid King.</p>

                        <hi>Hercules</hi> granting their petition, accorded it unto the people: and took this curſed Tyrant <hi>Buſire,</hi> and bore him upon his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, unto the Temple, which the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> ſhewed him.

When <hi>Hercules</hi> came into the Temple, he ſacrificed him, after he had ſhewed him his curſed and evil life. And then when the fire was put unto the Sacrifice, it began to rain, and the great drought began to fail: Whereof the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> were ſo joyful, that none could expreſſe.

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N like wiſe as the young Vine, by the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and induſtry of the labourer, groweth in height, and his boughes ſpred abroade full of fruit: ſo Hercules, by vertue labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring vertuouſly, grewe in verdure of well dooing, and in fruite of nobleneſſe: his workes, his boughes, his braunches then beganne to ſproute abroad, and to mount and ſpread from Realme to Realme. The ſecrete conſpiracies of Iuno, and her curſed enuyes might not hurt, nor miniſh the vertue of Hercules. The more that ſhee thought to put downe and hurt him, ſhe more ſhe was cauſe of his exaltation. As hée was puiſſant and ſtrong of bodie he was yet more ſtrong of vertue, for vertue was ſet in him, as the precious ſtone is in golde, and as the ſwéete ſmell as in the flower, and as the ray of the Sunne beame is in the Sunne: hée was belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of Kings, of Princes, of Ladyes, of Gentlewomen, of Nobles, and of baſe folke: in eſpecially Megara the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of King Creon loued him. And verily ſhée was not deceyued: for Hercules loued her alſo, and was neuer hurt but he thought on her. Yet they durſt none of them ſpeake to other of this matter: they were aſhamed to diſcouer that, whereby they had hope to haue honour and worſhip. They behelde each other, and oft they bewayled, and complained to themſelues, and deſired the day that they might take each other in marriage.</p>
                     <p>And ſo much they wiſhed after that day, that at the laſt it came. For on a morning tide, as Hercules was gone vnto the wood, for to take a wilde beaſt, he remembred him of his Ladie, and beganne to ſpeake and ſay to himſelfe ſoftly.
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:7118:137"/>
Shall I be alway in paine? Shall mine heart neuer be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but alway languiſhing in loue? I ſée one and other in great ioy with their loues and ladies, and I wote neuer how to come to the point of one onely, that I haue choſen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all other, and for to atchieue my purpoſe I wot not how to beginne. I dare not ſpeake to her, nor I haue not aſſayed if ſhée would condiſcende. Shall I ſpeake to her I wote not wel? If I ſpeake to her, and ſhe refuſe me, I ſhall fall in deſpaire. I ſhall die for ſorrow of melancholie and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, I ſhall neuer dare come after in any noble aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly a foote. Alas, what paine? all conſidered, a time muſt come that I ſpeake to her. If all her friendes were of one accord, for to giue her to me in marriage, and ſhe were not content and pleaſed, all were loſt. The moſt ieopardie is, to haue her good will and grace, for without her grace I may nought do. Then it is of neceſſitie, that I ſéeke and require, if I may haue her good wil, ſince it is ſo: for if I ſléepe thus and ſpeake not, I ſhall neuer atchieue nor come to my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hercules</hi> reſolute in his purpoſe, ſurpriſed and enflamed with great deſire of loue, came from the wood, and abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the wilde beaſt, and gaue it ouer, for to come vnto <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gara,</hi> thinking how, and by what words he might come and ſhew vnto her that which lay on his heart. He went then ſo farre, that he came vnto the garden of the pallace, where he was with many ladies and gentle women. He made to them reuerence, vntill he eſpied the time that he might ſpeake to <hi>Megara,</hi> and he waxed ſo penſife that it is maruaile: hee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitted nothing to conferre with the Ladies, but there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he drewe him apart into the garden. When the Ladies beheld him ſo penſife, diuers of them came to him, and talked with him to put him from his thoughts and penſifeneſſe, but they could not, and at laſt <hi>Megara</hi> came to him. As ſoone as Hercules ſawe her come to him, he beganne to ſigh, and came againſt her. And ſhe ſaid to him, Hercules, why are ye ſo penſiue, put away from you ſuch melancholie, &amp; tel me
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:7118:137"/>
of your newes I pray you? Ladie (aunſwered Hercules) I thanke you of your good viſitation, and ſince it pleaſeth you to heare of my tydings, and to knowe them, I will ſay to you a part. Firſt I tell you, that the cauſe that I am brought and put in the abiſme or ſwallowe of penſiueneſſe and ſighes that is this day come vnto me, is by beholding of you: for as I went to the wood to hunt, the remembrance of your right noble beautie, continually being in mine ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, came into me, and made me enter into a ſecret per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexitie, that is to wit, whether I ſhould alway liue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guerdoned, and vnrewarded of loue, and alſo (if I durſt ſay ſo to you) I haue ſet my heart and loue wholy on you. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame this perplexitie was great, but in the end I concluded to come vnto you, for to know the concluſion of my fortune, whether it be death or life. Being in this deliberation (thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king how I might ſpéed with you) and ſtaying in this point and doubtfulneſſe, your comming hath put me out of a right great thought and penſiueneſſe, for I wiſt not better howe to come to the poynt for to ſpeake to you a part) as I may now doo) then for to apply the matter in time, for I ſay to you for truth, that ſince the tyme of my Olympiade, I haue deſyred you night and day, and at that tyme I ſet my heart on your ſeruice, reſoluing to loue you for euer. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame, I knowe and wote well, that I haue enterpriſed a thing that I am vnfitte and not woorthie of. This not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, I abyde your mercie, and require you, that it may pleaſe you to receyue mée into your grace, in ſuch wyſe, that ſhortly I may ſée the day of our mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryage, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>When Megara vnderſtoode the words of her loue Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules, ſhe in heart reioyced with great ſolace, and much ioy, notwithſtanding ſhe was abaſhed, and all ſhamefaſt ſhe aunſwered thus. Alas Hercules, by what fortune finde I mee in the grace of ſo gentle a man as yée hée? Your exceſſiue proweſſe, your glorious labors, your reſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant vertues be ſo much of value, that ye are worthie to haue
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:7118:138"/>
to wife the floure of Ladies and the choiſe. With theſe wordes the gentlewomen came there vnto them, to beare their conferences of loue. And ſaide vnto Megara, that it was time for to withdraw her for to dine. Megara, ſorrowfull of haſtie departing, and that ſhe had no more ſpace to reaſon with her loue, &amp; that ſhe might not atchieue her purpoſe, by conſtraint toke leaue of Hercules, &amp; went into the hall, al ful fed with loue, and Hercules abode in the garden, glad &amp; ioyous of the ſwéet enſwere y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he had receiued.</p>
                     <p>When the Ladyes then had left Hercules in the garden, as ſoone as they were gone, Hercules aſſembled Euriſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us and Amphitrion, and ſayd to them, that he had great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and will to bee married, and prayed them that they would go to king Creon, to know if he would giue him his daughter Megara. They ſpake to king Creon of this mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage: the king heard them ſpeake right gladly, for the matter pleaſed him, and anſwered that he might no where better beſtow his daughter, then to the moſt noble man of the world Hercules, whom he loued as his owne ſon, which was ſo valiant and ſo noble, and had no fellow like vnto him: and that he was content to giue to him his daughter, and all with her that hee would demand. Euriſteus and Amphitrion thanked the King of his curteous anſwere. Megara and Hercules were ſent for: the king made them to troth-plyte each other, with great ioy of both parties. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this proceſſe of time, the day of the eſpouſals and marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age was celebrated with glorie, triumph, honour and ioy. What ſhall I ſay? they lay together without more adoo, and liued together right honeſtly.</p>
                     <p>Anon after the ſolemnitie of this marriage, Hercules came to King Creon, &amp; prayed him that he would dub and make him knight, for as much as they of the realme of Ico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie were come vnto him, and had choſen him for to be king of their citie, for his good renoume. The king Creon (ioyous of that, that he was choſen for to be king of Iconie) anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that hee would accompliſh his deſire: but hee would
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:7118:138"/>
that this ſhould be done at a certaine day aſſigned: ſaying, that then he would make a right noble feaſt, where men ſhould iouſt and turnoy, and that he would cauſe to come thither all the Kings and the Princes of Grece. Hercules accorded and agréed to the counſaile of the King, and then the King ſent his meſſengers vnto all the Kings of Grece, and prayed them to hee at the chiualrie and dubbing knight of a noble man, that ſhall hold a ſolemne ſport at a day, named and ſet, for to aunſwere all them that ſhall come to the iouſtes. The renowme of this foreſayde feaſt was anon borne and knowne vnto all the reignes of Grece: the prouiſion and ordinaunce was great in Thebes, one and other diſpoſed them for to be there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the tyme paſſed, and the day came, many a king &amp; knight was come at that time to Thebes. Theſeus and Iaſon the ſonne of King Eſon, were there amongſt all other. The kings made a great ſtirre, and great pompous ſhewes about ten of the clocke before noone. The king Creon went into the place that was ordained, arayed, and ready for the iouſts. At a corner in the ſame place there was a tent. In this tent was Hercules all alone. That ſame time the Ladies and gentlewomen went and mounted vppon the Scaffolds: the iouſters came into the place, no man knew nor wiſt not, who was this new knight. What ſhall I ſay? When the king Creon ſawe that the knights were come in on all ſydes, and that the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies were gone vpon the ſcaffoldes, hée ſent for Hercules and made him knight after their ſtatutes. And then Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules mounted vpon his horſe, tooke his Speare and his Shéeld, and chalenged them that were there, to the end that each man ſhould do his deuoyr. And then one and other that deſired to haue worſhip, tooke their ſpeares, and ran agaynſt Hercules, and beganne a iouſting that was right hote and ſharpe. Their ſpeares were ſtrong and brake not eaſily, but they met often tymes, and ſome were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowne and ſmitten downe off theyr horſes. They that might not iouſt agaynſt Hercules, aſſayed each other,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:7118:139"/>
like to like. Iaſon and Theſeus iouſted oft times agaynſt Hercules, and Pirothus ſonne of king Ixion in like wiſe. All they that I name, bare themſelues right valiantly. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, aboue all other, Hercules abode all men, and no man might abide his ſtrokes, but he bare them all down except Iaſon, which encountred him diuerſe times, and gaue him many great ſtrokes. Hercules bare downe Theſeus to the earth, and Pyrothus, &amp; well neare fiftie ſtrong knights. He did ſhew ſo much valour, that no man abode in the place but Iaſon and he. And then he left and ceaſed the iouſtes, for the valiancie that Hercules found in Iaſon, and euer after he had a ſpeciall loue to him, and tooke acquaintance of him, and feaſted him, and made him great cheare.</p>
                     <p>At the end of this iouſting, knights, ladies, and gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women went vnto the pallace. There was Hercules made king of Iconie. The feaſt was great and rich, more then I can rehearſe: the ſtrangers were greatly feaſted, and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thanked in common. What ſhall I make long proceſſe? When all the feaſt was paſſed, with honour and glorie of Hercules, and there was no more to do, whereof any me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie is for to ſpeake of, Pirothus praied al them that were there to be at his wedding in Theſſalonique, at a certaine day named. Each man promiſed him to go thither, and bée thereat. Euery man tooke leaue of Hercules when time was come of departing, and each man returned into his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey and place: and they could not inough maruaile of the glory abounding, and likely to abound, flouriſh and fructifie in Hercules, which was very courteous and humble, and was not proud for the grace that he had in temporall honour and renowme. He was ſo vertuous, that he was not the more high minded therfore, nor enhaunced himſelfe, but the more méeked and ſubmitted himſelfe.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. III. ¶How the Centaures rauiſhed Hypodamia at the wedding of Pirothus: and how Hercules recouered her againe, and vanquiſhed in battaile the Centaures.</head>
                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Or to continue our matter, then when Hercules ſawe approch the day of the wedding of Pyrothus, he diſpoſed him to go thither. By ſpace of time he went foorth on his way, and tooke Philotes with him: and at all aduenture tooke with him his armor of the ſkin of the lion. When Megara ſaw him depart, ſhe was ſore troubled for his departing. And the more for that, that he tooke his armour with him: for ſhe thought, if Hercules had heard ſpeake of any great exploit, he would go thither, and endeuour himſelfe to aſſay himſelfe agaynſt it. With great ſighs ſhe looked after him, as farre as ſhée might, praying to the goddes, that they would bring him ſhortly againe. Hercules and Philotes went forth into the Countrey, and as much as they might they haſted ſo their iourny, that they came to Theſſalonicque, where they were receyued with great ioy of Pyrothus, and of his friendes. They found there a right great aſſembly of noble men, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and Gentlewomen. Theſeus and Iaſon were there. The friends of Iaſon would that Iaſon ſhoulde bée made knight. And for to do that, they preſented him to Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules, which gaue him the order of knighthood. And Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les ſaid, that he had ſéene in him a good beginning of a noble man, and if he may liue, he ſhall attaine one day to things right high and noble. Among other things the day of wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding came, the citie was all full of nobles, &amp; the Centaures were there: they were an C. Giants armed, that ran as the wind, which the king Ixion had got him in Theſſaly, of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <pb n="262" facs="tcp:7118:140"/>
ſome dwelled in Moloſe, and the other in Aphyte a Citie of Epyre, whereof was Quéene Hypodamia the Ladie and bride of the wedding. There were many kings and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, of whom I haue not the names. The quéene Hypoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia and Pyrothus were wedded together after their law. When the time of the dinner was come, they ſet the Ladie in the hall, where was made a generall feaſt. At this feaſt all the commers were amply ſerued with all maner of good wines, and good meates: in eſpeciall the Centaures made paſſing good chéere, and drunke ſo much of the ſtrong wines, that the principall captaine of all named Eurycus, and ſome of the other, had words togither, and troubled the feaſt. In this trouble they ſought togither, and caſt each on other pots, platters, wines and meates, ſo terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, that many of them were hurt and dead. Then anon was the hall full of noyſe. Euricus and fiftie of his giants iſſued out of the preaſe, and went to fetch their hardeſſe or armour. When they were armed, they entred into the hall, and not content with the trouble that they had made (albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it that Hercules and the other indeuored to appeaſe them that ſlew each other) they tooke the quéene Hypodamia, and bare her out, and rauiſhed her, and fled away with her. When the Ladies ſaw this great outrage, they cryed out all afraide. The affraie was ſo great, that Hercules, Iaſon, Pyrothus and Theſeus, ranne vnto them, and when they knew that the Centaures had rauiſhed the Lady, at fewe words they went and armed them anon.</p>
                     <p>Hercules did on the ſkinne of the Lion, and tooke his ſword, his bowe, and his arrowes, and then went after the giants without abiding for any other companie or perſon. The giants were withdrawen vnder a trée, and there they trained them in battaile, as they that wiſt well and ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the firſt that ſhould come to them, ſhould be Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les. They hated Hercules ſecretly, and had enuie at his glorie. They ſwore all the death of Hercules: and then when they were in theſe tearmes and ſpéeches, Euricus
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:7118:140"/>
eſpyed from farre Hercules, and ſhewed him to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie. Hercules was all alone, and came not a pace ſoftly as a man, but he came running as nimbly and ſwiftly, as the hart runneth in the vally, and it ſéemed that he flewe in the ayre. The ſwiftneſſe of Hercules abaſhed nor afrayde not the Centaures: they were about foure ſcore, and they were all of great courages: they tooke then their Speares, Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>axes, Swordes and other weapons of warre, and ſome of the ſtrongeſt of them were agaynſt Hercules: on the other ſide, as ſoone as Hercules approched ſo nigh as hée might ſhoote at them, he bent his bow, and with an arrow he ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>e a Centaure named Grineus, in ſuch wiſe that the arrow pearced the head, entring by the viſage, and nayled and faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his head vnto a trée that ſtoode behind him. With the ſecond arrow hée ſmote another Giant, named Petreus, in the breaſt through the armour, that it went through his body. With the third hée hurt Dorillas, a terrible Giant, and nayled his hand vnto his face, and the arrowe entred with ſo great might (as afore is ſayde) and made the hande to be faſtned to his face: of which ſtroke he was dead.</p>
                     <p>He ſhotte many mo arrowes then, as long as hée had any: and hée ſhotte none, but with it hée hurt or ſlew one of the Gyants. When his ſhotte was fayled, the Giants, béeing ſore gréeued for that they had ſéene theyr fellowes die by the ſhotte and ſtrong hande of Hercules<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they cryed vppon Hercules, and enuyroned him on all ſides, Siſacus, Pheotones, Neſſus, Mincus, Stilo, Lodeuin, and Piſeon, were the firſt that ſmote vppon Hercules with their Swoordes. Hercules tooke hys Sword, and came agaynſt Pheotones, that had a great Axe, ſo great that it was a mans burthen. Pheotones a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non lift vp his great Axe, and thought to haue ſmitten a mightie ſtroke vpon Hercules. But Hercules that knew inough of the warre, turned him from the ſtroke, and ſo the great Axe fell downe to the ground. And then ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:7118:141"/>
Hercules caught that great axe, and plucked it out of his hands, and forthwith gaue him a ſtroke withall, ſo great that he ſmote of his right arme with the ſhoulder. &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Such was the beginning of the battaile of Hercules, and of the Centaures. Cilarus ſmote then Hercules behinde, with all his might. Piſeon and Ledeuin ſmote him alſo both at one time: notwithſtanding Hercules was not once aſtoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therewith, but running to Cilarus, he gaue him a ſtroke with the axe ſo luſtily on his helme, that it entred into his body, ſo that he ouerthrew the giant to the earth, and he ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in likewiſe Piſeon and Ledeuin. Iaſon and Theſeus put them then in the battaile, and well proued theyr youth, at their comming. For to giue the other heart and courage, Hercules thruſted into the greateſt preaſe of the giants, and ſo wrought with the axe, that they curſed Pheotones that had brought them thither, and all them that had gone about this matter. In beating and ſmiting down all before them, Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules began then to ſéeke Hypodamia, &amp; found her al bewept, right beſide and nighe Eurycus. Then he ſpake to Euricus. and ſaid to him: thou euil glutton thou haſt this day troubled the feaſt, and ſtolen the Lady of my fréende Pirothus, and now anon I wil trouble thy ſpirit: with this word he diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his axe, &amp; ſmote with-al Eurycus, in ſuch wiſe on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> head, that he fell downe dead, vnto the great gréefe and amaſing of the other giants: For, in beholding the are dyed with the bloud of Curyens their captaine, they were al abaſhed. Then began Hercules to ſmite more and more vpon the giants: there was none then ſo reſolute, but he was affraide: nor none ſo hardy, but he began to hide himſelfe, and tremble for feare. His ſtrokes were not to be born, but he put his enimies out of araye, and vnto flight. Fynally, with the helpe of Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, of Theſeus, and of Pirothus, that were meruailous vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, they vanquiſhed and chaſed them vnto a riuer, where twelue of them ſaued themſelues in paſſing and ſwimming ouer, and all the remnaunt of them were perſecuted vnto the death, ſaue only Lyncus that Hercules helde priſoner, for as
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:7118:141"/>
much as at the diſcomfiture, he prayed him of mercy, and yéelded him vnto him. Thus were the Centaures deſtroyed, more by the ſtrength ond hand of Hercules, then by any other. When Hercules had ſo fought that there were no mo of the Centaures vpon the place, he and his fellowes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned vnto Hypodamia, and brought her againe vnto the Cittie with great tryumphe. What ſhall I ſay? the Ladies recouered ioye by the recoueraunce of Hypodamia, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed and beganne againe the feaſt, that dured afterward eyght dayes right great and ſumptuous. &amp;c</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this time, that is to wit a little before the wedding of Pyrothus, as Pluto (the king of Moloſe, ſonne of Saturne, and brother of Iupiter.) ſayled and went by ſea, ſéeking his aduentures, ſo long hée ſayled that he arriued in Sicill, and hee founde there nigh by the waters ſide a right great aſſembly of Sicyliens that halowed the feaſt of their goddes. When Pluto ſaw this feaſt, he did arme twentie of his company vnder their robes or garmentes, and went in this manner for to ſée the feaſt, for to wit if he might finde any booty. This Pluto was the greateſt théefe, and the moſt lecherous man in all the world, and had with him a Giant named Cerberus, enough like vnto Pluto of conditions and of courage, but he was much more ſtronger and more puiſſant of body. All the other were great as giants, and had learned nothing els but for to prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe

Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> then the Sicilians ſawe Pluto come and his fellowes, they ſuppoſed that it had béene ſome of their neighboures that came for to ſée theyr playes and ſports, for as much as they came clothed in theyr garmentes, and ſawe none of theyr armour nor harneis. And they enforced them to ſing and daunce. But Certes their ſongs and theyr daunces were not continuing nor dured long: for in coming vnto them there, the king Pluto caſt his eyes aſide, and ſawe there the Quéene of that countrey that beheld the feaſte: and by her, her daughter that made a garland of floures. The mother was named Ceres and the daughter was called Proſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pina, &amp; was maried vnto a noble man, named Orpheus, that ſate beſide her and played on the Harpe. This Proſerpina was paſſing meruailous fayre. Anon as Pluto had ſéene her he deſired and coueted her, and aduertiſed his folke ſecretlye of her, and after came nigh vnto her, that he ſet hands on her, and layd her on his backe and bare her away.</p>
                     <p>When Orpheus and Ceres ſaw Proſerpina ſo taken away they cryed out piteouſly and lamentably vnto Pluto. With this crye, the Sicilians left their feaſt, and ran after Pluto in great number, men and women, hoping to haue reſkewed Proſerpina. But when Cerberus and his complices ſawe the vprore, they drew out theyr ſwordes, and ſhewed theyr armes and ſmote vpon them that approched them, and ſlea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them aboundantly, they retyred, and went vnto the port Maugre the Ciciliens and Orpheus. They guided Pluto into his ſhip, and after they entred, and then diſancred and carryed awaye Proſerpina. The Cicilians were then diſpurueied of armes. They coulde not withſtand the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away of Proſerpina. At the departing from the porte was made the moſt ſharpe lamentation and ſorrowe that could be. Proſerpina wept ſore on the one ſide piteouſlye, and cryed right highe and loude. Ceres on the other ſide, with the Cicilians, made no ſcarcitie of teares, and Orpheus fayled not to furniſhe his teares with déepe

At their departing, their hearts were brought to a hard and grieuous diſtreſſe, with ſo great anguiſh that Proſerpina fel downe in a ſounde: and Orpheus was ſo rauiſhed with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, that he returned vnto his Pallace, when he had loſt the ſight of Proſerpina, and held him cloſe in his chamber, with out ſpeache two dayes.</p>

                     <p>When Pluto ſawe Proſerpina ſo ceaſing her wée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, hee was paſſing ioyous: hee awoke then Cerberus and the other that ſlept: after he ſpake to Orpheus and ſaid to him, that he had ſo well harped, that no man could do bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: and that hee would that he ſhould demand ſomething, and he would giue it him without any faile. Orpheus hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the words of Pluto, had great perplexitie in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, for to knew what thing he might demand: in the ende he ſayde to him. Sir, I am Orpheus the huſband of this ladie, and for her loue I haue enterpriſed to come hither in this caſe nowe: I pray and require you, that yée will giue and render her againe to mee, that I may bring her againe vnto her mother that dyeth for ſorrowe. When Pluto had heard the requeſt that Orpheus had made, hée

                     <p>Orpheus ſéeing that by his vnhappineſſe he had loſt his wife, beganne to curſe the day that he was borne, and came after, and followed Proſerpina, and beganne againe to harpe, and to offer great gifts, for to recouer her againe, but it was ſaide to him for concluſion, that hee ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer haue her againe: and alſo, that if he had vſed the feats of armes, as he had the ſtrings of the harpe, he ſhould haue died. With this concluſion Orpheus departed from hell full of ſorrow and anguiſh, and returned into Sicill, vnto the quéene Ceres, telling to her his aduenture. The quéene being acertained that her daughter was in hell, as ſhe that was aduertiſed, that in Theſſaly ſhould be halowed the feaſt of the wedding of Pyrothus, and that there were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny knights, of great name, ſhe went to the ſea, and came fitly to Theſſalonica, while the feaſt yet endured.

After ſhe demaunded of them, if there were there no knights of great name, and high enterpriſes? when they vnderſtoode that ſhe enquired ſo farre: they would knowe what ſhe was, and demaunded her name? I am (ſayde ſhe) the Ladye Ceres of Sicill. Then ſpake Theſeus and ſayde: Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame, ye bée welcome: for what occaſion demaunde you, if in the feaſt be any knightes of enterpriſe? I can well ſaye to you, that there be truly: but notwithſtanding I doo wiſh you, I praye you, and alſo require, that ye tell and declare vnto vs the cauſe why ye haue ſo demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. &amp;c.</p>

Wherefore I praye you, if ye know any that wil to me be mercifull, that it pleaſe you for charitie to direct me vnto him.

And the king Pluto ſhall neuer haue peace with me vnto the time that he hath reſtored your daughter.</p>
                     <p>When Pyrothus heard the enterpriſe of Theſeus, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to breake of his words, and ſayd to him. My brother, what thinke you to doo, when ye enterpriſe for to go into hell? ye knowe not the boundes nor the ſituation of that place. Hell ſtandeth behinde the inner ſea betwéene mountaines

Theſeus aunſwered vnto Pyrothus, and ſayde: There is nothing impoſſible vnto a valiant heart.</p>
                     <p>The King Pluto is cruell and ſtrong, his folke and people tyrannous. His Cittie ſtandeth in a Countrey enuyroned with mortall perills.

A manne to kpeepe his owne honoure and worſhippe ought not to doubte anye perill what ſoeuer it ſhoulde be. &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>When Pyrothus had heard the noble anſwer of Theſeus, he allowed it greatly, and ſayd to him, that his wordes were to him right pleaſing and ſo acceptable, that he would holde him company in this aduenture. The Quéene Ceres than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked the two Knightes: ſo they brought her into the Cittie and into the pallace. She was there receyued and feaſted as it apperteined. The ſtealing away of her daughter was told, and the enterpriſe of the two Knightes. By the reporte of this aduenture, and with the enterpriſe that Theſeus and Pyrothus hadde made, all the feaſte was troubled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne on a newe. Among all other Hypodamia conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that her huſbande that was ſo newlye marryed vnto her woulde go in this perillous voyage of hell, her hearte beganne to giue out wéeping of teares,

and might receiue no ſolace nor comfort vnto her eyes. What ſhall I ſay? the feaſt ended in great ſorrow. Iaſon and Hercules would gladly haue gone with Theſeus and Pyrothus, and ſpake thereof to them, but they would not ſuffer them. Then departed Hercules and entred into a ſhip, as if he would haue gone into his countrey. Each man in like wiſe departed, and Theſeus and Pyrothus tooke their way for to go vnto hell. And then about their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, whereof Hercules was aduertiſed, Hercules made for to direct his ſhip vnto the marches of hell, and there went a land alone, concluding in himſelfe that he would go after Pyrothus and Theſeus his loyall and true fellowes, and betooke to Philotes the charge for to bring Lincus vnto Thebes, and for to put him there in priſon vntill his retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and comming againe. After, he departed, and Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes ſhipped in the ſea, where he had a dolorous aduenture, as ſhall be ſaid heereafter.

Pyrothus that knew the countrey, found the direct way that went to the Citie, and entred firſt therein.
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:7118:145"/>
This way was ſo ſtraite, that there might no man but one alone go neither on the right ſide, nor on the left ſide, the rocks were ſo high, that no man might go on neither ſide. When they had paſſed this way, they found a rocke carued and cut into ſtayres or grées, made and hewed out with chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels. And then they ſawe lowe beneath, Hell, as a Cittie ſtrong, enuyroned with waters that fell downe impetouſlye and fearefully from the rocks, and made a terrible noyſe and roring: for they fell from right highe into a lowe ſwalowe or abyſme in the earth. This Cittie was all encloſed with mountaines. For to ſpeake properly, it was a right Hell, and it had no more but one entrie and one gate: then for to come downe to the gate, Pyrothus and Theſeus deſcended downe by the degrées made in the rocke. Then in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſceding ſodaynlye they ſawe ſpring from the gate a greate giant out of meaſure, that had an head meruailouſly miſſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, fierce blacke and vglye. He had his noſe high and and wide, his Chin long, his téethe great as a horſe téethe, his eyes great like vnto an oxe, his eares hanging like an hounde, his ſhoulders large and broade, his bellye ſwo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len and great bolned, his legges and his thighes were paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſtronglye bened and mightie. This terrible Giant was Cerberus, whereof is touched and rehearſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                     <p>The Poets named him the hounde with thrée heads, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering his right gréeuous and vnhappie liuing, which is compared and likened vnto thrée ſingular vices: that is to wéete, to pryde, to auaryce, and luxurye, or leache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. By pryde, he gloryfied himſelfe, and enhaunced him aboue all the men in the worlde with his force and ſtrength, for he was ſo ſtrong that no man might withſtande him. By auarice and Couetiſe, hee hadde an apetyte inſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for to gather to-gither treaſours, and tooke and bare awaye all that hée might haue or coulde finde. By lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urie, there was no man liuing of more foule lyfe then hee was: for hee hadde neuer doone other thing in all
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:7118:146"/>
his life then for to defile and rauiſh women and maydens, ladies and gentlewomen, &amp; ſo by good right the poets named him an hound with thrée heades, for he was ſoule as an hound that liueth in multiplication of ſinnes, and taketh therein his felicitie. O gréeuous felicitie? When Theſeus and Pirothus had eſpyed this enemie Cerberus come vnto them all armed, making the whéele in marching proudly vnto them, Pirothus ſayd to Theſeus. My brother, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde what enemie this is: hee that putteth him in ſuch pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rils for for the loue of ladies, ſetteth but little by his life. It behoueth vs nowe to liue or die, let vs now atchieue ioyouſly our enterpriſe. And to the ende that ye may not thinke but that I had leuer die then to haue reproch, I will be the firſt that ſhall beginne the battaile. Theſeus had no ſpace nor leyſure to aunſwere, for Cerberus came to them, and called to them, ſaying: What ſeeke theſe fellowes in hell? Wee come (ſayd Theſeus) for to ſéeke Proſerpina, whom Pluto hath taken away from the Quéene Ceres. Wée will neuer returne into our Countrey, vnto the time we bring her with vs. Truly (aunſwered Cerberus) if yée will returne into your Countrey, yée ſhall render and yéelde agayne Proſerpina, but I will forbidde you the returne. And this day I will preſent vnto you Proſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pina, my Sworde dyed in your bloud. And here you ſhall be buryed: yee ſhall neuer ſée Proſerpina, nor come no nearer then ye bée now. With theſe wordes hee lifted vp his Sworde, and gaue ſo great a ſtroke to Theſeus vpon his Shield, that hée did beare away thereof an halfe quarter, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>When Pirothus ſaw his fellow ſmitten, hée tooke his ſworde, and ſmote Cerberus on the one ſide. Theſeus ſmote him on the other ſide, and they gaue him two right great ſtrokes, ſo great that they made Cerberus to be chafed ſo ſore, that he began the battaile ſo vnmeaſurably, that he all to fruſhed and brake their ſhields, and their harneſſe, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo made his ſword to be dyed with their noble blood, as hée
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:7118:146"/>
had before ſaide. The battell was hard and mortall at the beginning. Theſeus &amp; Pirothus receiued many wounds by eager ſtrokes, their armes were all to hewen and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. The battaile endured long, and Pirothus did right wel behaue himſelfe: but Cerberus ſmote vpon him ſo vnmea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurably, that after many woundes giuen to him, he all to brake his helme, and cleaued his head in two péeces vnto the ſtomacke, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>When Theſeus ſaw his fellow die, he ſtroke with his ſword in great anger, and ſmote Cerberus ſo fiercely that he made him ſtagger, and go backe two paces. Cerberus would haue auenged him of this ſtroke, and ſmote vppon Theſeus a ſtroke, by ſo great force, that if the noble knight had not turned backe, Cerberus had borne and ſmitten him vnto the earth. This ſtroke of Cerberus fell vpon the earth, and entred therein, and Theſeus ſmote againe vpon his enemie, which had the heart ſo great, that he began to rore as an olde Lion, and ſmote Theſeus ſo fiercely with his ſworde, that hée all to brake his ſhéelde, and all to fruſhed his helme, that hée was all aſtonied at the ſtroke. But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way Theſeus abode in his place: and then Cerberus would haue brought him vnto deſtruction, following the euill ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture of Pirothus, if that fortune had not brought thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hercules, which came ſo fitly to reſkew, that Theſeus knew not elſe how to ſaue him.</p>
                     <p>At this poynt when that Theſeus was ſo aſtoniſhed, Hercules that was departed from the ſea (as is ſaid) came to ſtayres that were cut and made in the Rocke, and behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Theſeus all couered with blood, and Pyrothus dead, hée beganne to deſcende downe, crying to Theſeus that he ſhould not bée afeard nor take no dread. When Cerbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus ſawe and heard Hercules, he beganne to crie againe and rore, and aſſayled eagerly, for to be quite of him. Theſeus might no more, howbéeit that hee was recomfortes with the voyce of Hercules, but began to run now here and now there before Cerberus.</p>

                        <pb n="276" facs="tcp:7118:147"/>So much then haſted Hercules for to go downe the ſtayres or degrées in entring the place, and as haſtely as hée might he cryed to Cerberus, and ſayde to him. Tyraunt cruell, let the knight run and come to me: thou haſt put to death vpon the earth my good fréende Pyrothus, whereof I am ſorye certaine: and if I may I will take vengeaunce on thée for him. Cerberus hearing the ſentence of Hercules, ran no more after Theſeus, but taryed and behelde Hercules with a fierce looke, and aunſwered to him. So weneth he to auenge his ſhame that ſo beléeueth: I haue deſtroyed thy fellowe vnto the death, and vnleſſe thou excéede him in ſkill of armes and in bodylye ſtrength an hundred folde double, it is folye for thée to come hither: For I am Cerbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus the porter of hell, he that at report of my name all the world trembleth.</p>
                     <p>Thus ending his anſwere Hercules was at the foote of the rocke, and he had his club vpon his ſhoulder.

                     <p>Cerberus was not then put to death, at the requeſt of Theſeus. Notwithſtanding Hercules bound his handes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind his backe, and after he made him ariſe, and tooke him by the beard, and made him go vpon high on the rocke, and there he laid him downe, and bound his féete, his hands, and his necke togither, in ſuch wiſe that he might not, nor durſt not remooue. When he had done ſo, he went downe, and entred into the gate of hell, and leauing there Theſeus, hée went ſo farre that he found the pallace of King Pluto, and there came into the ſame hall where Pluto was with Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerpina. All they that were there, maruayled at him, when they ſaw him entred: for they knew nothing of the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comming of Cerberus, as they that left all the charge and keeping of their Citie to Cerberus, without hauing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny doubt or ſuſpition: and alſo they were ſo farre from the gate, that they might not heare of the battaile, nor knewe nothing what was befall to their porter. Then when Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules had founde Pluto and Proſerpina, hee had great ioy, and knew by tokens and markes of them there béeing, that it was hée, he addreſſed him to Pluto, and ſayd, Pluto, by thy malice Sicil is now all full of wéeping, and of teares, for the rauiſhing of this Ladie, which thou haſt not willed to yéeld, and render againe to her huſband Orpheus. I wote not what pleaſure thou haſt therein, but I will ſay to thée, that thou ſhalt receyue great diſpleaſure, in following the euill aduenture of Cerberus, whom I haue vanquiſhed and ouercome, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>With theſe words Hercules lift vp his club, and gaue ſuch a ſtroke to Pluto, that he ouerthrew him to the earth, ſo that he moued neither hand nor foote. When he had ſo bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Pluto, thinking that he had béene dead, hée aſſayled all them that were there that made any murmur, and put them
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:7118:148"/>
all to death lightly with his club in the preſence of Proſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pina, which trembled for feare. Then he comforted Proſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pina, and ſayd to her, that he was come vnto that place for to deliuer her, and for to bring her again to her mother, and that ſhe ſhuld boldly follow him, Proſerpina aſſured and reſolued, was comforted with theſe words of Hercules, and followed him.</p>
                     <p>Hercules opened the hall, and went out, and Proſerpina with him. After he addreſſed him vnto the gate of the Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, and it happened to him that he found there a right great companye of Cittizens, that were aduertyſed of this affray, and they ran vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him vnmeaſurably purſuing him to death. When Hercules ſawe that, he willed Proſerpina that ſhe ſhould get her a part. After that he enhaunſed and lifted vp his club, and began to ſkirmiſh with his enimies right ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly and by ſo high proweſſe, that he couered all the entry of the Pallace with theſe miſerable, tyrauntes that he flewe, ſmote downe, and all forfruſhed them, and put to death more then foure hundred. Finally he wrought ſo that the other fled and gaue it ouer: and then when he ſaw his euil willers dead and ſcattered, he tooke Proſerpina by the hand and lead her out of the gate of the cittie.</p>
                     <p>Theſeus (that abode and taryed at this gate, as is ſayd) greatly reioyced when he ſawe Hercules come againe with Proſerpina: he aroſe and went againſt them, and ſaluted the ladye, and preſented to Hercules a chayne of a diamond yron that he had founde at the gate, and many pryſoners bounde, that Cerberus had bound withall. Hercules vnbounde the pryſoners, and tooke the Chayne, and bound Cerberus with, all. And when hee had buryed Pyrothus, he departed from this hell, and tooke his waye with Proſerpina, Theſeus and Cerberus, and without great adoo for to ſpeake of, made ſo his iourney, that hee arriued there in Theſſalonica, and deliuered Proſerpina to the quéene Ceres: and to Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damia, he preſented Cerberus, rehearſing to her and the Ladyes, how he had ſlain Pyrothus. Hypodamia had ſo great
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:7118:148"/>
ſorow for the death of Pyrothus, that for to recount and tell, it is not poſſible. All they of Theſſalie likewiſe made great mourning and ſorrowe, and ſore bewayled their lord. What ſhall I ſay? for to reuenge his death. Hypodamia did cauſe to binde Cerberus to a ſtake in the theater of the Cittie, and there young and olde tormented and vexed him thrée dayes long continually, drawing him by the bearde, and ſpitting at him in the vyſage, and after ſlew him inhumainly and horriblye. And then when Hercules and Theſeus, Ceres and Proſerpina had taryed there a certayne ſpace of time in comforting Hypodamia, they tooke leaue togither, and Hercules went accompanyed with Theſeus towarde the cittie of Thebes.

Of this ſhippe or galley was Captayne and chéefe, Andromedas King of Calcide. This Andro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medas was Couſen vnto Lyncus. When he hadde e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpyed the ſhippe where Lyncus was in: he made to rowe his
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:7118:149"/>
gallie abroade, and ſaid, that he would know what people were therein. In approching the ſhip of Thebes, Lincus beheld the gallie of Andromeda, and knew it by the ſignes and flags that it bare. In this knowledge Andromeda ſpake, and demanded of the marriners, to whom the ſhippe belonged? Anon as Lincus ſaw and heard Andromeda, hée brake the anſwere of the marriners, and cryed to him all on high. Andromeda, lo héere thy friend Lincus. If thou giue me no ſuccour and helpe, thou maiſt looſe a great friend in me: for I am a priſoner, and Hercules hath ſent me into Thebes.</p>
                     <p>Andromeda hearing Lincus, had great anger, for he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued well Lincus, and called to them that brought him, and ſaid to them, that they were all come vnto their death. And alſo that they were vnder his ward. Philotes and his folke were furniſhed with their armes and harneſſe, and made them all readie for to defend themſelues, and with little talke they of Calcide aſſayled Philotes, and Philotes and his folke employed them at their defence. The battaile was great and hard, but the ill fortune and miſhappe turned in ſuch wiſe vppon the fellowes of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotes, that they were all ſlaine and dead. Andromeda had two hundred men in his companie, all robbers and théeues on the ſea. Theſe théeues and robbers ſmote hard and fiercely vppon Philotes, and all to hewed his armes, ſtriking and giuing to him many wounds, and hée buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed manie of them in the ſea. But their ſtrong reſiſtance profited them but little, for in the ende he was taken and bound, and Lincus was deliuered and vnbound from the bonds of Hercules.</p>
                     <p>Lincus had great ioy of his deliuerance: he then than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked his good friend Andromeda. After this, he tolde him how he was taken, and how Hercules had diſſipated and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the Centaures. And among other he named ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his friends that were dead, whereof Andromeda had ſo great ire and ſuch diſpleaſure, that he ſware incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently,
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:7118:149"/>
that he would auenge it. And that as Hercules had ſlaine his friend, in like wiſe he would deſtroy his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins and kinſmen. Lincus tooke great pleaſure to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the oath of Andromeda which would auenge the death of his kinſmen. He ſaid to him, that Hercules was gone into hell. And after demanded him how he would auenge him vpon the friends of Hercules? and thereupon they were long thinking. In the end when they had long taken aduice, Andromeda concluded, that hée would go aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile the Cittie of Thebes, and if hée might gette it by aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault, hee would ſlea the king Creon and all them of his bloud.</p>
                     <p>With this concluſion came thither all the gallies of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dromeda which followed, in whom he had eight thouſand fighting men. Andromeda made them to returne toward Thebes, and as haſtily as hee might hee entred into the Realme, waſting and deſtroying the countrey by fire, and by ſword ſo terribly that the tidings came vnto the king Creon. When the king Creon knewe the comming of the King Andromeda, and that without defiance, he made him warre, he ſounded to armes, and aſſembled a great companie, and knowing that Andromeda was come into a certaine place, hee iſſued out of Thebes all armed, and brought his people vpon his enemies, that had great ioy of of their comming. And then they ſette them in order a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, in ſuch wiſe, that they came to ſmiting of ſtrokes. The crie and noyſe was great on both ſides, ſpeares, ſwords, darts, guiſarmes, arrowes and polaxes, were put forth and ſette a worke. Many Nobles were were beaten downe and dead. Lincus and Andromeda fought mortally: the King Creon and Amphitrion fayled not, there was bloud aboundance ſhed on the one ſide and on the other. And the battaile was ſo cruell and ſharpe then, that in little while after Andromeda and his people gatte and wanne vppon them of Thebes, and conſtrained them to retire and for to go backe: whereof
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:7118:150"/>
the king Creon had right great ſorrow, and wéening for to haue put his men againe in aray, put himſelfe in the greateſt preaſe of the battaile where he fought mortally, and made ſo great a ſlaughter and beating downe of his enemies, that Lincus and Andromeda heard of the ſkir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh, and then they came togither. And as Lincus ſawe the king Creon do maruailes of armes, hee gaue him thrée ſtrokes one after another, and with the fourth ſtroke, he all to brake his helme from his head, and ſlew him, whereof they of Thebes were ſore afraide, and diſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſo, that they were put to diſcomfiture, and fled: which flying Amphitrion might not remedie, albeit that he was ſtrong and of great courage.</p>
                     <p>Of this euill aduenture Thebes was right haſtily ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſed. Megara was gone vp vpon one of the high towers of the pallace, and ſawe and beheld the battaile: and from that place ſhe ſaw them of Thebes ſlaine without reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and alſo turne their backs. The ſight of the bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting downe of the king her father, and the view of the ſlaughter of other made her to crie out and ſaid. Fortune, Fortune, what miſchiefe is héere? where is Hercules? Alas where haſt thou brought him? Alas that he is not héere to defend the countrey of his natiuitie, and for to kéepe his wife farre from annoy, and for to put his hand and ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders for to beare the great acts and deedes of this bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile?</p>
                     <p>When ſhee had ſaide this, ſhe fell in a ſwoune, and ſo lay a great while. Neuertheleſſe, the king Andro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meda and Lincus, followed ſo haſtily them of Thebes, that they entred the Citie with them. And for as much as the Thebans were without head, and put out of aray, and that Amphitrion had ſo many wounds vpon him, that all the members failed at this worke, the vnhappie Lincus and Andromeda tooke the Citie, and flewe all them that might beare armes, except Amphitrion, whome they found not in the heate. After they went vp into the pallace,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:7118:150"/>
and there they found Megara and Amphitrion in great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, with many ladies and gentlewomen.</p>
                     <p>As ſoone then as Lincus had eſpied Megara (ſhe was ſo faire and pleaſant) that he became amorous of her, and came to her and ſayd. Ladie wéepe no more: Hercules the baſtard ſonne of Iupiter, is gone into hell, and there he is dead. Ye haue béene wife of a man gotten in adulterie, from henceforth ye ſhall be fellow and wife of a man legitimate, and borne in lawfull mariage, for I will wed you, and will do you more good and pleaſure then euer yee had. Megara anſwered: falſe traytour, wéeneſt thou that I be ſo fooliſh as to giue fayth and credite to the words of the homicide of my father, and to the enemie of my lord Hercules? Knowe thou that I am his wife, and that I will neuer haue other huſband but him: he is no baſtard, but ſonne of my Lorde Amphitrion, and the moſt noble man that is in all the world. Ladie (aunſwered Lincus) I am king of this Citie, ye be now at my commaundement, will ye, or will ye not, I ſhall do my will with you, but I will put it in reſpite, and in my ſufferance till to morrowe. After theſe wordes Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus ſent Megara into a Tower, and made her to bée kept there.

                        <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Y the ſword of Lincus then and of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dromeda, Thebes was troubled dolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly. Lincus exerciſed there many tyrannies and wickedneſſes. In this miſfortune Andromeda departed, and went to do his buſineſſe, leauing there Lincus with foure hundred men of warre, for to kéepe the citie, and to hold it in his obeyſance. Thus was taken vengeance of the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taures. In the time of this reuenge, the Quéene Iuno came into Thebes, and had great ioy when ſhee found it in deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and full of widowes and orphelins, and in the enemyes handes of Hercules: then were great the teares and lamentations of Megara. Amphitrion was nigh her, who vnderſtoode all her gréefes, and comforted her. Lincus came many tymes vnto her into the priſon, and requeſted her ſwéetly to haue her loue, and that in the fayreſt maner he could. Yet his ſwéete and fayre wordes auayled not, for hée found her conſtant and firme, and alway kéeping in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable her chaſtitie, and gaue him many vertuous aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweres, whereof foloweth one, which was the laſt, and this. Lincus, thou haſt now thy hand ſtrong, and haſt conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Thebes. Fortune and ill hap hath giuen vnto thée the tyranny, whereby thou haſt enriched thy ſelfe with vices. Thou haſt furthermore the power for to commit on mée murther: but thy power, nor thy ſinnes be not ſo ſtrong, nor of ſuch might, for to make my vertue to bow in two folde. Megara alway bewailed Hercules: ſhe lamented ſo much on a day, that ſhee became all rauiſhed, and in a traunce.
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:7118:151"/>
And that ſame day Hercules that was departed from Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalonica a good while before, made ſo his iourneys, that hée entred into the realme of Thebes accompanied with many noble men. And entring into theſe coaſts, hée found the countrey all deſtroyed. And he had not gone farre, when it was tolde him, how Lincus was Lord of Thebes: and how he had ſlaine in battaile the king Creon, and had impriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Megara, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>When Hercules had receyued theſe tydings, he was repleniſhed with great anger, and ſayd, that he would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge him if he might. Then he clad him aboue his armors with a mantle, and diſguiſed himſelfe as much as he might: when he had ſo done, he left there his fellowes, and entred himſelfe into Thebes vnknowne, and paſſed through the gate, and bare him ſo well, that the Porters let him paſſe foorth: and in likewiſe entred into the Pallace. At the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of the Pallace, a ſouldiour came to Hercules, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded of him what he ſought there? Hercules caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his mantel a farre, and took his ſword that was ſtrong, and without any worde hee gaue ſo great a ſtroke to the ſouldiour that was not armed, that he cleft his head from the higheſt part downe to the ground. Many other ſouldiours that were there, ſéeing the ſtroke, cried, and béeing afrayed, ran to their axes and clubs, and ſome were of them that put forth themſelues for to take Hercules: but Hercules ſmote off their heads, and beat them downe: and then began to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe a great vprore, and ſo great a noyſe, that Lincus heard it. And thinking it had béene his porters that quarrelled, hée came running downe all vnarmed, for to make peace. As ſoone as Hercules perceyued, and ſaw him comming out of the hall, he drew vnto him with his ſword readie drawne in his hand, crying, Hercules, Hercules, and ſmote him ſo that he cut off the right arme, and with the ſtroke he fell downe to the ground. And after he ſmote vpon one and other, that had no helmes on their heades, nor habergions on theyr backes, and then they knewe that it was Hercules. Hée
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:7118:152"/>
ſlew them ſo thicke, that with the bloud that ranne downe, was made a right great ruſhing, as if it had béene a riuer.</p>
                     <p>Among theſe things the gentlewomen of Megara iſſued out of the pallace, and went into the ſtréetes crying with high and cleere voyce, that Hercules was come againe, and that hee had ſlaine Lincus. With theſe cryes all the Citie was mooued, the good men olde and yong, the widowes, wiues and maides ranne vnto armes with great courage, and aſſayled all about the men of Lyncus. There was a terrible battaile, and many people gathered togither, men &amp; women againſt their enemies. In a little while all the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie was troubled. When Hercules had put to death al them that he found in the cloſe of his pallace, excepting Lincus whom he put in the guard and kéeping of the Quéene Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no, and of many Gentlewomen that came vnto him: then hée ſprang into the ſtréetes, and ſhewed his ſword, and ſmote downe right on all ſides in ſkirmiſhing ſo mortally with the men of Lincus, all about where he might finde them, that by the helpe of them of Thebes, he made them all to paſſe the ſharpeneſſe and cutting of his ſword. And then was Thebes all glad: and Hercules returned into the pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, vnto the place where the ladies kept Lincus. Then Hercules ſent for to breake vppe the doore of the chamber where Megara was in, for as much as they could not finde the keyes, for they that kept her were dead. Megara then full of gladneſſe came vnto her lord. Hercules roſe vp to her, and would haue embraced her, and kiſt her. But Lincus, that thought on nothing but for to do euill, by the ſecret per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of Iuno, turned him from it, ſaying: Hercules, let be my concubine, I haue taken my fleſhly deſires with her: ſhe is of mine acquaintance, and the moſt luxurious ladie that euer I was acquainted withall.</p>
                     <p>When Megara heard the right great iniurie and wrong that the traitor charged hir with, ſhe fel backward for anger being furious, without ſaying of any word. Hercules was al
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:7118:152"/>
full of anger, and hote and full of great ire, wéening that Lincus had ſaid truth, ſo he ſmote off the head of Lincus, and with the ſame ſword that he had ſlaine the traitor with, he put to death Megara, who was with childe. Howbeit the Cronicles of Spaine tell, that Hercules ſlew not his wife, but that he put her into a religious houſe, that he ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Thebes in the temple of Diana, renouncing her companie: and there it is ſaide, that this was the firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion that euer was in Thebes. Theſe things accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in the one manner and in the other, Hercules went forthwith and tooke out of priſon Amphitrion and Philotes, and departed from thence al angrie and ſore gréeued: ſo that at that time and long after he ſpake not: and went his way at all aduenture, accompanied with Theſeus and Philotes, with the great bewailing of them of Thebes, which then after his departing crowned ouer them Layus the ſonne of King Agenor of Aſſirie, for as much as he had wedded the daughter of the king Creon named Iocaſta.</p>

although he ſuppoſed that Hercules was in the army lan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded at the Port, whom he doubted, he marched vnto his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies which ioyed at his comming. And then beganne the Troyans and the Gréekes a right hote ſkirmiſh, with ſo great murther and manſlaughter, that at the ioyning there was many a man hurte. Hercules fayled not to ſmite and trouble his enemies: he caſt his eies on high, and ſaw the banner royall of Troy: he fought and ſmote downe on the right ſide and on the left ſide, and with his club he ſmote downe vnmeaſurably, that he came to the banner, and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding there Laomedon that did maruailes of armes vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Gréekes, he ſmote him with his club often times vpon his helme, in ſuch wiſe as he might not ſaue himſelfe, and that he pearced his club within his head and braine, and with one ſtroke he ſlew him among plentie of Gréekes lying dead on the ſea ſand, ending there his miſerable life.</p>
                     <p>After hee ſmote vpon them that bare the banner, and rent the banner, and then were the Troyans all diſcomfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and cryed: Let vs flie, let vs flie. And with this crie that was impetuous, they beganne to retyre and go backe vnto the Citie wéening to ſaue themſelues. But the Gréekes ſpoyled them with the poynts of their ſwords and cuttings of their ſharpe glaines, ſo mortally, that in ſleaing and killing the moſt parte fell dead like as the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt had runne among them. They tooke the Cittie, ſo troubled with the death of the King Laomedon, that there was none or right little defence among them. In entring into the gate of Troy, Thelamon was the firſt man, and Hercules was the ſecond, and then Hercules founde well the hée did right high chiualries.

                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter this generall deſtruction of Troy, when the Gréekes were departed, and Hercules had left them, the Gréekes returned into Grece, with great glorie, and Hercules went by the Sea ſéeking his aduentures, accompanied with Theſeus, and Philotes: and it happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him, that as he arriued at the port of Alexandria, he found in this port a great armie. When the Captaine of the armie ſaw him come to ankre, he knew by the enſignes of Hercules, that it was Hercules: and for that he had heard him recommended aboue all maner men whatſoeuer they were: then hee came vnto him all full of ioy, and ſayd to him, Lord of nobleneſſe and treaſure of vertue, among the people, moſt mightie, and among the kings moſt reſplendant in all glorious vertue, I ſalute you, and requeſt you, that I may be your ſeruaunt and friend.
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:7118:155"/>
And thus ſaying, he was on his knées before Hercules, and in ſigne of humilitie, he kiſſed the earth. When Hercules ſaw the ſalutation and the maner of the doing of this man, he tooke him by the hand, and (lifting him vp fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ground) ſaluted him, and after demaunded of him his name, and to whom that army belonged that he ſawe there? He anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him, that he was named Affer, ſonne of Madiane, the ſonne of Abraham, and that in that army was none other captayne nor chéefe but himſelfe, and that the Egyptians had ordeyned him duke and leader of this hoſte, for to go into Libie, for to deſtroye the countrey in vengeance of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill and harmes that the tyraunt Buſyre, that was of Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bie hadde doone to them, in ſuche wyſe as hee well knew.</p>
                     <p>When Hercules had vnderſtood the name and the affayres of Affer, he tooke him for his fréend: and ſayd to him, that he would accompanye him to conquer Libie. After he than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked him, and brought him into a right rich ſhip, where he feaſted him as much as to him was poſſible. They had not long abiden there, but they went vnto the ſea with great gladneſſe, for the Egyptians were ſo ioyous and gladde to haue Hercules with them, that they thought and beléeued verily, that there might no miſhappe nor euill come to them. Hercules found in the ſaid ſhip of Affer, the wife and alſo the daughter of Affer, This daughter had to name Echée: ſhe was the moſt faire gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman of all the world, and yong and freſh. By the dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſight of her, Hercules became amorous of her, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired her to be his wife. Echée anſwered, that of her ſelfe ſhe might not accord to his demand: but ſhe ſaid, if fortune giue mee ſo great a grace that I might be your wife, I ſhould haue more cauſe to thanke the gods, then any wife liuing. Hercules was right well content with the Damoſell: and by her perſwaſion, called Affer, and required him that hée woulde giue to him his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to bee his Wife. Affer thanked Hercules for that hée
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:7118:155"/>
vouchedſafe to demaund his daughter: he that was the moſt excellent of nobles: and ſayd to him, that he ſhould take her and doo with her his will and pleaſure. Hercules e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpowſed and wedded Echee, by the conſent of Affer, and they lay togither, paying the due debte of mariage in ſuch wiſe that Echee conceyued of the ſéede of Hercules. What ſhall I make long proceſſe? Hercules and Affer ſayled ſo long that they found the porte of Lybye, where nowe ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth Carthage, and there they arriued and tooke land, in a night which was cléere, and after they entred haſtely into the countrey, and beſéeged the Cittie of Lybie, without reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance or gaynſaying.</p>
                     <p>In this Cittie was then a great giant named Antheon great aboue meaſure aboue other giants, the moſt ſtrong and the moſt conquering that was in all the partes of Europe and Libie, Cirene, Trypoly, Mountaynes and all the Iles enhabited in theſe countries vnto the Iles fortunate. This king then aduertiſed of the coming of the Egiptians, was paſſing angry, and ſware that neuer none of them ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne agayne into Egipt.</p>
                     <p>Aſſoone then as he might he did cauſe his men to arme them and iſſued out of the cittie with a great company of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byans, and had ſo great haſte to runne vpon the Egiptians, that he ſette no order among his people, whereof he tooke great harme? for when he came to the battaile, hée founde that Hercules had trayned his people, and ſet them in two battailes, of which he lead and conducted the firſt battaile. It happend ſo, that they of the ſayde companye of Hercules, by force of ſhot, bare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues ſo valiantly, and with ſtrokes, that they brought to death more then fiftéene hundred Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biens. When the ſhot fayled, Antheon ſprang into the greateſt preaſe, as the moſt valiant, and ſuppoſed wel to haue ſkirmiſhed with his enimies: but anon as Hercules ſawe him come, hée layd hand on his club, and put him foorth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and gaue him ſo great a ſtroke, that he made his head to bow on the left ſide. Antheon had his ſword lifted vppe
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:7118:156"/>
for to haue ſmitten Hercules, when he receiued the ſtroke that Hercules gaue him, by which his ſtroke was broken. Neuertheleſſe he ſaid betwéene his téeth, that he would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge him: ſo hee lifted vp his ſword againe, and ſmote Hercules ſo vehemently, that with the ſtroke he brake his ſhield. Then knew Hercules, that the giant was a man of great ſtrength. This notwithſtanding, he ſmote him the ſecond time with his club: and thus Hercules and Antheon gaue each other ſo great ſtrokes, that there came betwéene them of the two parties, Libians, and Egyptians. There was a great noyſe of clinking of ſwords and ſounding of the ſhields and helmes that were broken, and halberds that were diſmailed, ſhieldes quartered, and glaiues broken: there was the bloud largely ſhed on both parties. Hercules and Antheon were parted by force of the preaſe. Antheon by great ire ſmote without ceaſing vpon the fierce Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians: Hercules all broke the helmes largely with his club, and did with the Libians all his pleaſure, and brought ſo many to death with his club, that in little time he paſſed throughout the whole power of king Antheon many times, and in his way he couered the earth and the way that hée held all with dead Libians. The firſt ſkirmiſh was ſtrong and damageable to Antheon: for againſt one Egyptian that he flew with his ſword, Hercules made die with his club ten Libians. About Hercules was nothing but bloud, Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules made the mountaines redounde with cries, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies to tremble, the Libians to flie and go backe, and wan little gaine. What ſhall I ſay more? as long as the day en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured he helde the battell in vigor, and about the euening, when Affer and Theſeus came to the fight, he beſtirred himſelfe in ſuch faſhion againſt Antheon, that he made him flie, all charged with horions and ſtrokes, and then in like wiſe fled after the Libians.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen Hercules ſaw the Libians turne into flight, he did cauſe to ſounde the retrait, for as much as it was late, and with great glorie returned into the place that he had choſen for to holde his ſiege at. His wife Echée came againſt him with open armes and be clipped and kiſſed him: ſhe holpe to vnarme him, and brought him freſh water for to waſh his face with, and there was made right good chéere of all the Egyptians. Contrary to this good chéere, the Libians were in the Citie and made great ſorrow, for they had loſt neare thirtie thouſand men: eſpecially Antheon made ſimple cheare, for he had good cauſe: for Hercules had ſo beaten him with his club, that hée might not helpe himſelfe, but went with great paine to bed, and with ſorrow ſent for his Phiſitions and Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons, which came and viſited him, and founde him all bruiſed, and ſaide to him, that it would bee well neare a moneth ere they could heale him Antheon conſidering his caſe, ſent and deſired of the Egyptians truce for the ſpace of a moneth, offering to them for to ſend them dayly a certaine number of cattell, and a right great quantitie of victuals. Then he made out his commaundements, and ſent vnto al the kings and princes that were his tributaries, and alſo vnto his neighbours, praying them that they wold come &amp; ſuccor him with their men of arms, in the moſt haſty wiſe that they might. This truce ſo made, Hercules began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:7118:157"/>
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that before time he had heard Philotes ſpeak of a king that reigned thereby named Athlas, and that he was the moſt wiſe man and cunningeſt of al the world, and that he dwelt in a Caſtle ſtanding on the top of a right high mountaine named Athlas, after the name of the ſame king. In this remembrance, Hercules being couetous of the ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Athlas, called Philotes and ſaid to him, that hee would go into the Realme of the king Athlas, and that his intent was to ſéeke there his aduenture. Philotes an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered and ſaide, that he could well leade and bring him into the Realme, for he knew the countrey. Then Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules called Affer and Theſeus, and charged them, that they ſhoulde alway make good watch. And after tooke leaue of them and of his wife, ſaying that he would haſtily returne. This done, hée and thrée mariners with Philotes went vnto the ſea in a gallie-finely made and light, and ſayled and rowed into the ſea Mediterrane: they had ſpéedie winde and readie, and Fortune was good to them. In little while they came vnto the ſtraite of Gibraltar. And then Philotes ſhewed vnto Hercules the mountaine and the caſtle where Athlas was at that time abyding.</p>
                     <p>When Hercules ſawe the mountaine and the caſtle, he went and tooke land ioyouſly: after he tooke his clubbe, and commanded Philotes and his marriners for to abide them there. Then he went toward the mountaine, and it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened that he met with a man that diſcended downe from the hil, and he adreſſed him toward the ſaid man, for to heare ſome tydings, and demanded him from whence hée came? He ſaid, I come from the caſtle that ye may ſée yonder on high. Whither go ye, ſaid Hercules? vnto the Citie of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celie, anſwered the ſtranger: the king Athlas to whom I am ſeruant, hath ſent me thither to publiſh his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vnto the Citizens, that within ſixe dayes they ſhould be furniſhed with their armes, for to accompanie him to go vnto the warre of the great king of Libie,
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:7118:157"/>
which requeſted inſtantly to haue his ſuccours. Wherefore if ye will ſerue him in this armie, and be his ſouldiour, go vp and ye ſhall finde him in his Caſtell ſtudying the ſcience of aſtronomie. The ſeruaunt of King Athlas with theſe wordes went forth on his way, and Hercules went vp into the mountaine, and came to the gate of the Caſtell, where hée found foure knights, that demaunded of him what he would haue? Hercules anſwered, that his will was for to ſpeake to the king, for certaine matters that touched him. The foure knights (not thinking but good) brought Hercules within a great hall, wherein were all the men of king Athlas, aſſaying them with ſwords and axes, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as they had heard ſay, that they ſhould go to warre and they were all armed.</p>
                     <p>When theſe knights had brought thither Hercules, they gaue knowledge vnto the king, that a ſtrange giant aſked after him, and would not tell them the cauſe why? Then Athlas went downe, and found Hercules armed with his ſkinne of the lion, and aſked him what he was? Then he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered and ſaid, hee was Hercules that hath conquered Philotes and the garden with the ſhéepe of thy daughters: I am now come hither for to conquer thée with thy ſciences. Wherefore it behooueth thée, that thou do to me obeyſance, and giue ouer to helpe the great Antheon mine enemie, and that thou come to me. And if thou wilt not do ſo, arme thée haſtily, and defend thée with armes, and that I demaund of thée: and if thou wilt not conſent thereto by loue, I will make thée accord to it by force. Athlas was excéedingly diſcouraged when he knew by the mouth of Hercules that it was he that had late conquered Philotes, and had ſlaine the giant his fellow, taken his ſhéepe, and alſo newly had aſſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by warre Antheon, to whom he had promiſed to giue ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours: and alſo conſidered, that he willed that he ſhould yéeld him to him: his heart then began in him to ſwell for anger and pride, and in great rage he ſaid to him O thou preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Hercules, how art thou ſo hardy to come alone before
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:7118:158" rendition="simple:additions"/>
me: thou that I may not loue? Knowe thou that I haue had many a diſpleaſure by thine outrage, for Philotes was my right great friend: and nowe thou art come to renue this diſpleaſaunce, and wilt that I ſhould yéeld mée vnto thée, that is not mine intention, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Athlas with theſe wordes went into a Chamber there faſt by, and commanded that euery man ſhould arme him, as they did. Hercules had alway his eie vpon him, to the end he ſhould not eſcape him. When he was armed, he came againſt Hercules, and chalenged him to the death. After he gaue him a ſtroke with his ſworde fiercely. With the crie and with the ſtroke, all they of the fortreſſe aſſayled Hercules. Then Hercules put himſelfe in defence, and laide about mightily by the rigour of his club, and with twelue ſtrokes he ſlue twelue of his enemies. After he hurt and wounded many other, and ſpared long the blood of Athlas. But in the end, foraſmuch as Athlas gaue great ſtrokes to Hercules, Hercules ſmote him vpon the helme, without imploying of all his ſtrength, and gaue him a wound in the head, that all aſtonied he bare him to the earth. From that time forth they of the fortreſſe, durſt no more aſſaile Hercules, nor they aduentured them not for to reſkew, nor to reléeue Athlas, but fled thence out of the Caſtell, and Hercules abode there alone with Athlas, and the dead bodies. So in the end when Hercules ſaw that they had giuen it ouer, he tooke Athlas, and made him to crie him mercie. After he went into his ſtudie, and tooke all his bookes, which he laded vpon a camel, and after returned vnto Athlas, and conſtrained him to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him. And when Hercules had done in the Caſtel all his pleaſure, he departed accompanied with Athlas, and with his bookes, and brought him downe to the ſea ſide, to the place where Philotes abode him, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>When Philotes ſaw Hercules come with Athlas, and his bookes, he had great ioy, and tooke acquaintance with Athlas, who was ſo ſorrowfull that hée might not ſpeake: and then they entred into theyr Galley, and went vnto the

The Damoſels aunſwered, that they abode the two knights, and that they were readie to do déedes of armes againſt them, vnder the condition of their quarrell. And if they were come, they would come forth.</p>
                     <p>Hercules and Theſeus, with this anſwere tooke their ſpeares, and ſpurred their horſes, and made ſigne vnto the Damoſels. And they furniſhed with Shieldes and with Speares, ran agaynſt them ſo chiualrouſly, that it ſéemed that they helde of heauen, not of earth, and at the coping of their ſharpe ſpeares, the ſtrokes were ſo huge and great, on both ſides, that Hyppolita and Theſeus bare each other vnto the earth: and in like wiſe did Menalippe and Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules.

                     <p>Theſe words began to quicken, and to wake againe the blood of Theſeus that was afore aſléepe, and to lighten the courage, in ſuch wiſe that he recouered a new force and ſtrength, and put himſelfe forth, and began to ſmite with ſuch proweſſe, that he made the Damoſell recant, and tooke from her, her ſworde, and conquered her: whereof the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes were much gréeued and ſorrowfull, and in eſpeciall the Quéene Synope, which then ſent to Hercules her armes, in token that ſhe was vanquiſhed, praying him that he would yéeld againe and render the two Damoſels. And Hercules tooke the armes of the Quéene, and ſent to her Menalippe, and made peace with her for the Affricanes, vpon condition, that ſhe ſhould giue Hyppolita in mariage to Theſeus, which was amorous of Hyppolita. So then the wedding was made in Affrique with great honor and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. And the Ladies hearing tell of the maruaylous acts and déedes of Hercules, prayſed him all, and held themſelues happie and fortunate to be vanquiſhed of him.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XV. ¶How Hercules began to waxe amorous of Deyanira: and how Achelous &amp; Hercules had battaile the one againſt the other: and how Achelous was vanquiſhed.</head>
                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter the conqueſt of theſe ladyes, The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeus tooke leaue of Hercules and of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, and returned into his countrey, for to bring home his lady, and went to the ſea, for to go into Calcedony which lyeth in the oppoſite of Achaie &amp; of Arcadia, for to ſée a fayre ladye of excellent beautie, that he had heard greatly recommended by a Calcedonien that was in his companie. He did ſo much, what by ſea and by land, that he came into Calcedonie. The king of that place had to name Oeneus, and had two daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, the one named Deyanira, and the other Gorge. Dey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anyra was the fayreſt, and that was ſhe that Hercules came for to ſée. When Oeneus had vnderſtanding and knowledge that Hercules came into his countrey, he had great ioy, and went againſt him, and receyued him embracing him ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourablye as was to him poſſible. In entring into his pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, the Quéene and his two daughters Gorge and Deia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nira welcommed Hercules. Incontinent as Hercules caſte his eyes vpon Deyanira, that was the moſt fayreſt woman that euer he ſawe, and that ſhe by deſire right déepe was ſettled and rooted in the moſt déepe place of his heart, he felt himſelfe rauiſhed meruailouſly. This deſire entred into Hercules all full of rayes of loue, and pearſed into his heart as ſodaynlye as the rayes of the ſunne paſſe through the glaſſe.</p>
                     <p>Deyanyra had ſo much beautie, and was ſo well accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and ſo gliſtering and ſhoone among the ladyes, that to her might be made no comparyſon, not all onely in beautie,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:7118:164"/>
but with that in wiſedome and bountie. She was the moſt precyous treaſure of Calcedonie: and thither came many La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes &amp; gentlewome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and other. Hir neighbors were al amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of her, and eſpecially the king Achelous that was ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g and puiſſaunt. This king had great ſeignory, and marched thorough the realme of Calcedonie. When then Hercules had béene there a ſpace, in paſſing the time ioyouſly, and in beholding the behauior of Deyanira, it happened on a day that the meſſenger of king Achelous came to Oeneus, and ſayd to him, that Achelous demaunded of him, if he would giue him his daughter: and that if he would not giue her to him at this time, he would moleſt and gréeue his countrey, and would make him warre. At this meſſage Oeneus was troubled, and anſwered the meſſenger, that on the morrow he would giue him an anſwere. All that day Oeneus was penſiue, and ſorry, and abode alone: and for to paſſe his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, he came to Hercules. When Hercules ſawe him ſo penſiue he adiured him in earneſt wiſe that he ſhould tell him the cauſe of his penſiuenes: who tolde it him, and ſayde. Lord Hercules, ſince it pleaſeth you to know of mine anoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and gréefe, I will anon tell you the cauſe. There is hereby a king my neighboure named Achelous, great and fierce and proude, which many times hath required to haue to his wife Deyanira my daughter. I haue not béene in will to accord the mariage, for aſmuch as I knowe this king a man of right euill life. And for this cauſe I haue had many menaces of him, and alſo this day his meſſenger is yet come againe to me and hath ſayde to mée, that if I giue him not my daughter at this time, he will make mée war. Certes Hercules, if ye ye ſée me penſiue, it commeth to me by this occaſion, for I haue not yet giuen him his aunſwere, but I muſt giue it him to morrow.</p>
                     <p>Neuertheleſſe, I haue concluded in my ſelfe that I will not giue vnto him my daughter. And now when I ſée veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that by the refuſe of my daughter, it muſt néedes be that the war be open betwéene the aforeſayde king Achelous and
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:7118:165"/>
me, know well that I am diſpleaſed: for warre is the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall deſolation of the countrey, perdition and waſt of the people and of goods.</p>
                     <p>Sir (ſaid Hercules) it is néedefull vnto a man that he take and beare all that fortune will. As ye ſay, warre is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing of people, but dimunition, yet by that extremitie it behooueth to paſſe, It is expedient that a man reioyce in his right. Right comforteth the courage of a man, and the courage of a man comforted, bringeth him often times to glorious victorie. A brute beaſt diſgarniſhed of reaſonable wit, fighteth for his hole and neſt, with his clawes, with féete, with his téeth, and with his bill. What ſhall a man ſenſible and endowed with wit and reaſon, do with any aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault (and namely in his owne land and territorie?) Nature willeth and inſtructeth that where corporall force faileth, vigour and vertue of courage worketh, and that they fight for their countrey. Take courage then in your right, and ſay your intent vnto your enemies: ye haue receiued mée worſhipfully, &amp; in my receiuing theſe tydings that be come, I wil help you if it be neede: and I ſuppoſe if Achelous aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile you, he ſhall repent him.</p>
                     <p>With theſe words the king Oeneus comforted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe greatly, and the day drewe ouer. On the morrow Oeneus called the meſſenger of Achelous, and ſaid to him, that he ſhould come no more to demaund his daughter: and that he was not minded to giue her to his maiſter: and furthermore, if he mooued warre againſt him for this cauſe, hee had intention to defende himſelfe vnto the death of the laſt man of his people. The meſſenger returned with theſe words, and tolde them to Achelous and all that hée found with him. Achelous was euill content with king Oeneus, and as hee that was ouermuch ſmitten with the loue of Deyanira, beganne to aſſemble his men of armes, in intention to make warre on king Oeneus, and to take from him his Daughter. Hercules was then in Calcedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, and often times he was with Deyanira in gracious
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:7118:165"/>
conferences. He found her ſo well adreſſed in all honeſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, that all day he was the moſt part with her, and in the night he did nought but dreame and thinke on her: howbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it, he ſayd nothing to her that touched his amorous deſires, willing firſt to ſhewe there his power in armes. It hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened on a day he opened a window that was by the garden of Deyanira, and caſting his eyes downe, he ſawe Deyani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nira, that ſate vppon a gréene place, accompanied with many Ladyes and Gentlewomen. Then hee ſet all his minde to contemplate the exceſſiue beautie of her. After he deſired her, and in coueting and deſiring ſaid. O Deyani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra, thou that haſt not the prerogatiue to know the hearts and the thoughts of men, if I ſhould ſay to thée the tenth part of the loue and deſire I haue to thée: thou migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt not beléeue it. I haue gone many a countrey, and ſéene mannie a Realme and many a treaſure, I haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired many a thing. But of all, for to come to my wiſhed bliſſe, I was neuer in ſo great thought as I am for to get thy grace.</p>
                     <p>The ſame houre that Hercules ſpake by himſelfe, Deya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nira was not idle: ſhee hadde Hercules in her minde, and remembrance, &amp; in hir heart, then being rich in the points of loue, ſowen betwéene variations of hope and deſpayre, was eſpryſed in all her veynes with the heate of that fire that burneth amorous hearts. This fire burning, was ſtrong and very hard to quench, or to couer the right pear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing ſparkle. Shée lay downe then vpon the graſſe, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to ſay in her minde. Alas Hercules, what ſhall Deyanira do? ſhe may not come to attaine vnto your loue, I was wont not long ſince, not to daigne to behold a man, and then ſaid, that neither Prince nor King ſhould haue my loue. Nowe I am all of another nature, and deſire no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, but that I might bee your wife. I haue ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to haue remained and continued a ſtable virgin, and I only was diſdainer of men, contrary to the requeſts and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions of the ladies: theſe be nowe farre other tydings.
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:7118:166"/>
with theſe words ſhe ceaſed a little, and beganne to thinke on many other things. At this point, as ſhe thought on Hercules, and Hercules on her, tydings came thither, that Achelous was comming for to beſiege the Citie, by land and by ſea, and that he was very neare by. For theſe tydings aroſe in the pallace a great murmuring, that came to the eares of Hercules and of Deyanira: their ſpirits were tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſed in ſuch faſhion, that Hercules left to behold Deyani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra, and the damoſell left to thinke on Hercules, and both two went vnto the king Oeneus.</p>
                     <p>Anon as Hercules came vnto the king, and that the King ſaw him, he went againſt him, and ſaid to him, that his enemies were verye neare the Citie, Hercules an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered ioyouſly, that it behooueth to go feaſt them: and willed that he put his people in armes. At this anſwere of Hercules, the king did ſounde to armes, and with this ſound all Calcedonie was mooued, and each man made him readie. Hercules and his Gréekes were ready in a little ſpace. The Calcedonians aſſembled by great companies in the pallace. When they were aſſembled, the king and Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules brought them into the field, and Hercules put them in order: that done, he did cauſe them to march, and the Calce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians and Gréekes ſo ſped them on an after dinner, that they came and found their enemies, and approched them ſo nigh, that there was nothing to do but to ſmite and lay on. Hercules had made two battailes, one and the firſt with his people, and the other with the Calcedonians. When they came to the poynt to méete, Hercules went to the Calcedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, and in the preſence of the king ſayde to them. Lo héere yee may ſée your enemies that ſette little by you, for they be come into your Lordſhippe to aſſayle you. I pray you that the great outrage of them abate not, nor mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh your courage. Ye ought herein to haue the fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of a Lion, the puiſſance of an Elephant, and bée gréedie as a Griffon, for to deliuer you without ende, from the enmitie of king Achelous, in kéeping your
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:7118:166"/>
countrey, your dominion, your honour, your treaſures, your wiues, your children, and that more is, your liues. Be ye then ſtudious to doe well, be ye inflamed with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of vengeance, be ye couetous to get worſhip and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. If ye ſhew not your ſelues valiant at this time, ye may not haue any thing but beggerie, or ſeruitude to death: for your enemies will doe vnto you all the euill of the world, if they haue victory ouer you. Theſe wordes wrought in the hearts of the Calcedonians, and gaue to them courage marueilouſly. And all they with one right good will deſired the battell. When Hercules had fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed his exhortation, hee went to the battell: for it was come to the point to fight. Then were there great cries on the one ſide and on the other: tabors, trumpets, clari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, harneſſe, and weapons began to ſound: knights be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſtirre at the entrie of the battell. Hercules and the Greeks ſhot and drewe largely vpon their enemies, and made Achelous all abaſhed, foraſmuch as hee hoped not to haue founde ſo great reſiſtance with the Calcedonians. Then they caſt their eyes vpon the banner of Hercules, and ſeeing the great Lion that was painted therein, they began to imagine that there might be Hercules, of whom was ſpoken thorowout all the world, for his vertues and his ſtrength.</p>
                     <p>When they were thus imagining, the ſhot failed, with great ſlaughter of them of the partie of Achelous. When the ſhot was ſo failed, Hercules tooke his ſword, &amp; went vp and downe among them of Achaie, that were in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> firſt front of the battell of Achelous, and there made an hole ſo great, that the Calcedonians &amp; the Iconians wan vpon them at the firſt ioyning, and made the other partie to recule, and goe backe, whereof Achelous had great ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: and hee tooke to him twentie knights which were choſen, and came &amp; ranged with them there, where Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules ſcattered and brake the battell of the Achaians. There hee approoued his courage luſtily. This ſtrong
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:7118:167"/>
giant, and his horſemen ſo valiantly fought, that the Gréekes entring taried and abode, and alſo Hercules: for they died their ſwoordes and the earth with their bloud, and beat downe many Iconians. And there was the ſtrife ſo great, that men might ſée nothing els but heades and armes flie into the fielde. Hercules ſmote no ſtroke but it coſt to Achelous the death of a man. Achelous in like maner ſtroke for ſtroke ſmote down one of his enemies. The reſidue of their folke did the beſt they could, now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, now behinde, and yet might neuer the Achayans confound and put backe their aduerſaries, howbeit they were alway foure againſt one: and the Iconians were in great number, and they had alway freſh people and new. In this maner the two puiſſaunces fought together more then foure houres. Loue wrought ſore there, in Hercules and in Achelous, both two made their ſwordes to flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh couered with bloud. They met oft times and ſmote ech other, but neuer durſt Achelous abide before the ſworde of Hercules, for the horible ſtrokes that hee ſawe Hercules giue, but he put him in the preaſe aſſoone as hée had ſmitten him, or had angred him.</p>
                     <p>In this battaile Hercules did wonders and maruailes. Oeneus tooke a great pleaſure to beholde him, and the Achayans had therein diſpleaſure, for they that ſaw him, were no more aſſured to eſcape the death, then he that fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There receiued no manne a ſtroke of him, but he abode in the place: he made ſo great a ſlaughter, that no man can well write it. In the end, king Oeneus with all his Calcedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians came to the battaile: in his comming the Achay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans receiued loſſe vpon loſſe, and perill vpon perill. The king Oeneus made many of his enemies to die. Hercules ſhewed his puiſſance more and more: by his well doing, he put the Achayans all out of aray, and after vnto flight: and the loſſe of the field turned greatly vnto the damage of king Achelous: for Hercules chaſed him ſhamefully
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:7118:167"/>
into his ſhippes, and made him to looſe twelue thouſand Achayans, &amp;c.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter this victorie, when Hercules ſawe that the king Achelous ſaued himſelfe by the ſea, he called the king Oeneus, &amp; ſayd to him, that he would purſue his enemie, &amp; that he would deliuer the world of him: and after tooke an hundred of his choſen men, and tooke leaue of the king Oeneus, and went to the ſea, following after Achelous, recommending him to Gorge &amp; to Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anira. In this night Oeneus after the departing of Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules, returned into Calcedonie, and tolde his wife and his daughters the high proweſſe that Hercules had done in the battaile, and how he had chaſed his enemies, and how he was gone after with two hundred men. The la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies Gorge and Deianara were right ioyous of the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, but it grieued them ſore that Hercules with ſo litle a company purſued Achelous: and aboue all other, Deia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nira was greatly vexed and grieued at the enterpriſe of Hercules, ſo ſore that ſhe went into her chamber, and was conſtrained to wéepe, and not to haue ioy in heart vntill the returne of Hercules. For to returne vnto the purpoſe touching Hercules, when he was put to the purſuit of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelous, as is ſayd, he entred into his realme, and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him ſo nigh, that hee was conſtrained to withdrawe himſelfe in a right ſtrong caſtle ſtanding by the ſea. Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules beſieged Achelous in this caſtle. When Achelous ſawe that Hercules purſued him with ſo little a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie as with two hundred men onely, hee called his friendes and his leaders of menne, and among other things tolde them, that it was a ſhame for them to ſuffer
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:7118:168"/>
themſelues to be beſieged with ſo little a number of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. They anſwered, that he had ſayd trueth: and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that the ſame houre they woulde iſſue out, and raiſe &amp; breake the ſiege, and foorthwith they ſounded to armes with ſhort counſell. It was not long after that they iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the caſtle, but Hercules eſpied them, and knewe that they came to the battell: he ſet his men in aray, after hee went alone before vnto his enemies, as he that doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of nothing. When Achelous ſaw him come, he began to make a great ſigh, and cried vnto his people, vpon him: ſaying that it was he with the clubbe that had chaſed him out of Calcedonie, and promiſed great giftes vnto them that beſt belaboured him with ſtrokes. But when his folke knew that it was Hercules, they made curteſie ech to other for to go before, and trembling as the leafe on the tree, they durſt not abide the weight of the clubbe: but without ſmiting of any ſtroke turned their backs, and fled vnto the caſtle.</p>
                     <p>Achelous ſéeing the behauior of his folke, and the dread and feare that they had of Hercules, wéened that he ſhould haue died for ſorrow: ſo he went and entred againe with them into the caſtle. And Hercules returned with his people, laughing at the poore dealing of his enemies. Hercules beganne then to thinke on Deianira, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelous beganne to imagine how hee might annoy the Calcedonians: hee had there one of his captaines that ſayde vnto him: Sir, yee know well that your ſtrength may not compare vnto the ſtrength of your enemies: we be tenne againſt one, but that may nothing helpe vs: for, alonely the clubbe of the mighty giant that is with them, is enough for to bury vs all, and alſo for to deſtroy your realme. Conſider ye then, ſince it is ſo, that open puiſſance and plaine ſtrength may not be vſed at this time, it is expedient to imagine ſome ſubtiltie, for to gréeue the Calcedonians: and it is mine aduice that there ſhall be made a great flaming light in the ſea, ſuch as I ſhall well
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:7118:168"/>
deuiſe, ſo as by that meanes they that haue beſieged vs, may be deceiued lightly. This flaming light muſt be by night, and it ſhall be great and forcible: we will make it ſecretly: aſſoone as our enemies ſhal ſee it, they wil leape out of their tentes, and will goe vnto the ſea for to ſee the marueile, peraduenture without any armes, for they dreade nor feare vs not, and then wee will ſet on them, and ſhall finde them vnfurniſhed and vnpurueyed of their armes, &amp; conſequently it may enſue, that of them all we ſhall make a notable riddance. &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>When Achelous heard this counſell, it ſeemed to him good, and hee would that it were put in effect in ſuch wiſe as he had deuiſed. The deuiſer did make an hundred tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which were finiſhed in fifteene dayes. During theſe fifteene dayes, Hercules aſſailed many times the caſtle, where Achelous was in, but he might neuer do any thing thereto, for the fortreſſe ſtood vpon the ſea, and in a ſtrong countrey, and might not bee gotten by aſſault, and Ache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous might haue no ſuccours from no part: for, betwéene this caſtle and Achaye was a great countrey. When the fifteene dayes were paſſed, and the torches were made, on a night when it was peaceable from winde &amp; ſtorme, they that carried the torches, iſſued out of the caſtle, foure of them vnto the hauen, where was left but one little boat which was on grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, and had not in long time afore bene put to the ſea. And if ye demand where the ſhippes were become that Achelous brought to this port, I ſay to you, that Hercules had cauſed to take them, and ſent them into the ſea, to the intent that Achelous ſhould not eſcape him, nor take away the ſhippes by night. The Achayans then came to this litle boat lying on the ground, and plied them that they brought it aflote on the Sea as ſecretly as they could, and entred therein, with all that to them was neceſſary. And the king Achelous put himſelfe in am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſhment with a thouſande of his men, in a place nigh whereas him ſeemed that the Calcedonians woulde goe
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:7118:169"/>
out for to ſee the light that ſhould be made. Then when they that were in the ſea, knewe that it was time to light their torches, they ſet them a fire and put them round about the maſt, wherein were made as many holes as was torches. And ſo as they had imagined, they did. Anon the knights that kept the watch of the hoſt of Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules ſawe it, and ſore marueiling at this light, awoke Hercules and his fellowes, and ſhewed them the light.</p>
                     <p>Aſſoone as Hercules ſaw the brightneſſe of the torches, he would knowe what it was: and then he approched the bancke of the ſea and his company with him, and had not béene long there, when the king Achelous did cauſe to light an hundred torches that hee had prouided, and after he iſſued out of his ambuſhment with his thouſand men, and ranne vpon Hercules, and aſſailed him and all his men fiercely. But when Hercules ſawe them diſcouer themſelues, he ſet his people in order in the beſt maner he might, by the light of the ſtarres, and receiued his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies couragiouſly, where began a right dolorous bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile: for the one ſmote on the other very felonouſly, and there were many wounded and dead. The ſkirmiſh was great. Achelous thought to ſkirmiſh, but he was ſkirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with himſelfe, vnto the effuſion of his bloud: for Hercules among all other ſmote him on the helme, that he foundred, and gaue him a wound on his head that the bloud guſhed out: and moreouer, hee tooke him, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered him to twelue of his men to kéepe. There were great cries, and great aboundance of ſtrokes of ſwordes. Then were the torches quenched and put out by the force of the ſmiting of the Achayans, which deſired great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to reſcue their king: and ſo they abandoned their liues in the heat. But when their torches were quenched a litle and a litle, they began to coole them, and withdraw them, for they ſawe nothing at all. When they were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawen, Hercules aſſembled his folke, and ſayd to them, that he would goe aſſay if he might take the caſtle in this
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:7118:169"/>
trouble, and that they ſhoulde followe him hardily and fiercely: and anon after, when he ſawe his enemies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne vnto the caſtle, he ranne after and ſtayed them, and put himſelfe in the thickeſt of them, and ſmiting with his club on the right ſide and on the left ſide, he made a right large place and way. And by this way he lead his people vnto the gate of the caſtle, where he entered with them that fled, and there made ſo great a ſlaughter of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, that with litle reſiſtance, that ſame night he put to death twelue hundred, and the other fled into the citie of Patrace, from whence they were. In this battell, and in the battell that had béene in Calcedonie, all the men of Achaye were ſlaine, except about a foure hundred, which ſaued themſelues by flying: for Achelous had taken all his men with him, his countrey and his citie Patrace was all deſtroyed. When Hercules had taken the caſtle, afterward he went into the countrey and into the citie of Patrace: and entering into all places without any reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, he ſet ouer this realme into the hande of king Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus, and he abode not long after that he had ſubdued this realme, but he departed and returned into Calcedonie as haſtily as he might for to ſée Deianira: and there he was receiued with ſo great glory, ioy &amp; triumph, that no man can rehearſe ne write. The Poets report and write this conqueſt that Hercules made vpon Achelous, faining that Achelous fought firſt in guiſe of a man, and that then he was vanquiſhed: after he changed himſelfe in a guiſe of a ſerpent. This is to be vnderſtood, in ſubtilneſſe and in malice, as he did in aſſailing Hercules by night. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, hée fought in the guiſe of a bull, and that Hercules brake his one horne: that is to be vnderſtoode, that at the laſt Achelous was fierce as a bull, for hee died well nigh for pride &amp; ſorrow that he was taken: and that Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules brake his horn, that is to be vnderſtood that he brake his realme and deſtroyed it.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Reat was the feaſt then, that the king Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus made for the victories that Hercules had atchieued vpon king Achelous: For he doubted him paſſing ſore. Hercules at his comming preſented to him Achelous &amp; his realme, and ſayd to him that he ſhould haue it without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny refuſe. The king Oeneus ſent king Achelous into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ile, and held himſelfe greatly bounden and beholden to Hercules who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he honoured marueilouſly. Then Hercules tooke to his heart againe right amorous conceits: and alſo in like maner did Deianira, ſhe had ſouereigne ioy to ſee Hercules, and deſired none other thing but for to ſee him. What ſhall I make long proceſſe? when Hercules had béene there a ſpace, he required king Oeneus that he would giue him his daughter to wife. Oeneus with right good will agréed, and accorded to him, and Deiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra conſented with better will. The wedding was ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized pompouſly and ſolemnely, and they went to bedde, and lay together. And ſoone after when Hercules ſawe that his father in lawe had his realme in peace, he tooke leaue of the king Oeneus, and departed from Calcedonie with Deianira and his people, for to goe by land into his realm of Iconie. Hercules had alway in his iourney Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anira by him: he loued her excéedingly, &amp; had great ſolace in her beauty: and if he had not ſtudied with Athlas, he could not haue abſteined him from beholding her beauty. In paſſing the time pleaſantly in the maner that folke do that be new maried, Hercules iourneyed ſo farre, that he came to a quarter of Theſſaly, where the riuer of Hebe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:7118:170"/>
runneth, and arriued on this riuer, which was déepe and broad running impetouſly, and had neither bridge nor plancke to paſſe ouer, but there was a Centaure na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Neſſus that ſpent there his life, by the meanes of a little boate, in the which he carried the people ouer the riuer, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>When Hercules had found this paſſenger Neſſus, he came to him, and demaunded of him howe he and his folk might paſſe the riuer? Neſſus that knew Hercules ſince the time that he had vanquiſhed his fellowes at the wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Pyrothus, aunſwered to him, that hee might not paſſe the riuer but by his little bote. And if hee woulde paſſe, hee would with a good will doe him the pleaſure to ſet him ouer. Hercules thanked Neſſus: And foraſmuch as he ſaw that the bote was but litle, and that the time was diſpoſed to raine, he would that Deyanira and her damſels ſhoulde paſſe firſt. Deyanira and her maidens entred into the bote. When they were therein, Neſſus rowed, and in the rowing, he beheld Deyanira, and hee looked on her ſo much y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> her beautie rauiſhed him. For as ſoone as he was come ouer on the other ſide, he took Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anira, and ſaid that ſhe ſhoulde be his wife, and then cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching hold on her, he tooke her on his ſhoulders and bare her away: wherefore Deianira and her damſelles made great cries. And Hercules ſeeing that the olde giant bare away Deianira, which he would reſiſt to his power, bent his bowe, and ſhotte an arrowe vpon the giant, with ſo great might and cunning that he ſmote him on the right ſide vnto the heart, and gaue him the deaths wound. The bowe of Hercules was ſo great and ſtrong that no man could bend it but himſelf. Neſſus, when as by his wound that Hercules gaue him, he began to féele y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> approching of death, and to ſuffer ſharpe anguiſh alway, he ran a great while after vnto a valley, where he fell downe, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that his life had no recouery, hee emploied the end of his life to imagine howe hee might doe diſpleaſure to
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:7118:171"/>
Hercules, and remembred that hee had terrible poyſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him and mortall, and ſaid to Deianira by great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice. Ladie, the loue of you hath cauſed me to receiue the death, which me diſpleaſeth not ſo ſore, as doth that cruel Hercules ſhall enioy you, which are worthy to haue a worthy man. Hercules is no true huſband, but the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trueſt to his wife that euer was. And foraſmuch as I haue ſingular pitie of you, and that your beautie conſtraineth me to doe you pleaſure, I will giue you heere a pretious thing, and hauing ſuch vertue, that if ye boyle it with one of the ſhirtes of Hercules with the bloud that runneth out of my wound, and if that ye giue the ſhirt to Hercules and that he weare it, he ſhal neuer after loue other woman ne lady but you.</p>
                     <p>And with theſe wordes the giant tooke the poiſon, and tempered it with his bloud, &amp; wound it in a linnen cloth, and gaue it to Deianira. The fooliſh Deianira giuing credence to the giant, tooke the poyſon. The giant char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged her that no man ſhuld touch it bare, ſaying that then it woulde looſe his vertue after the touching: and with that he gaue vp his ghoſt and died pitiouſly, and Deiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra eſcaped from his handes, purpoſing that ſhee woulde kéep that poiſon ſecretly at all aduenture, for to helpe her ſelf, if it were néed. In the mean while that theſe things befell betwéene Deianira and the giant, Hercules was not in heartes eaſe for Deianira: for he was in great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe when he ſaw Neſſus beare away his wife. Aſſoone as he had ſmitten him on the right ſide with his arrow, as is ſaid, he vnclothed himſelfe, and caſt his gown, his har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and club, ouer the water by great ſtrength, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he ſtarted into the water, and ſwamme ouer vnto the other ſide, and then as he put on his raiment, Deianira (again accompanied with her damſels that followed her) came to the riuer furniſhed with the curſed poyſon. When Hercules ſawe Deianira returne, hee imagined anon that he had ſlaine the giant, and went againſt her,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:7118:171"/>
and demaunded where the traitor was. Deianira aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered not at the firſt to this demaund, but ſaide to him: alas my Lord, in what perill haue I been? what oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion? what diſpaire of ioy hath oppreſſed mine heart?

Certes, I haue ſuffered a great ieopardy, but thankes bee to the goddes, ſince I haue found you againe.

                        <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>Eianira and Hercules kiſſed eache other by right great loue. After, Hercules went into the place where the giant lay dead, &amp; foraſmuch as hee found him depriued of his life, he let him lie there to the beaſts &amp; to the birdes, and tooke his arrow that lay by him. And this was the Arrow that Achilles was ſlaine with after in the temple of Phebus in Troy, for the loue of Polixene. Then Hercules and Deianira came againe to the riuer, and Hercules ſet ouer his men, and went fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that place into the citie of Lerna. The king of this Citie did great honor to Hercules, and receiued him as honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably as he could. Among diuers talk Hercules demanded him of his tidings. The king anſwered and ſaid, that he knew none other, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in a great pallace there dwelled &amp; abode a monſter half man &amp; half ſerpent, that deſtroied all
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:7118:172"/>
his realme by common murder. For he ſaid that all the men, women, and children that this monſter can finde, he ſlaieth them with his taile that is inuenomed, with his clawes armed he deuoureth, and deſtroieth them with his téeth, and there eſcapeth none. And ſo it will come to paſſe that this countrey be deſart: for the labourers nor marchantes dare not go by the countrey with leſſe compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie then two hundred men: and if they be leſſe, the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter aſſaileth them, like as he hath done many other, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Hercules was paſſing glad and ioyous of theſe tidings, and ſaid to the king: Sir, I haue laboured yet hitherto for the common weale of manie realmes, and yet haue I the will to perſeuer and to doe the workes of vertue. Know ye then, ſince that I am here arriued, I will doe ſomewhat for the weale of this countrey, like as I haue done for many other. And I haue intention for to put me in deuoire to morrowe on the way toward the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and for to abide the aduenture, to vanquiſhe him, or to be vanquiſhed of him. This monſter was called Hydre, foraſmuch as he dwelled in the waters. When Deianira heard the enterpriſe of Hercules, that he would go alone, and abandon himſelfe in ſo great perill, ſhee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to weepe and make ſo great ſorrowe, that no man might apeaſe her, nor make her ſtint her wéeping. Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules comforted her the beſt wiſe he could.

All that might not helpe nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile: ſhe loued Hercules with all her heart, with all her might and puiſſance. She required him with her eies charged full of teares, that he woulde abſtaine him from ſo high an enterpriſe; ſaying that it was no wiſedome fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="333" facs="tcp:7118:172"/>
yet her teares that ſhe wept, nor her praiers, nor her rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons can cauſe Hercules to breake his purpoſe for to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe this aduenture. But on the morne earely he cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed him, and departed from Lerne, and tooke his way toward the moore, whereas was the monſter.</p>
                     <p>This moore was long, and thrée miles in compaſſe, as the Chronicles of Spaine rehearſe, and all enuironed with fountaines that ſprung out of the high mountaines. In the middeſt of this plaine was a great lake or pond, wherin dwelled the Hydre on dry land. When then Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules was come to this place, the Hydre that neuer ſlep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules abode when he eſpied the maruellous monſter, and had great pleaſure to ſee him: he was ten foote of heigth, and had as a long a taile: he was foule and couered with haire: he had his body armed, and in his right hand held a naked ſword, and in the left hand he bare a ſhield. Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules thus beholding him, ſuffered him to come to him. Then the monſter ſpake to him and ſaide: poore giant whether goeſt thou? behold this ſworde ſharply on both ſides cutting: yet was there neuer man that heard me ſpeake, but he died by the point of this ſword. Foraſmuch as I am the moſt wiſe creature that euer nature made, and that I am accuſtomed to make a queſtion to ſuch men as I finde, and then to deſtroy them if they cannot aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere thereto. And foraſmuch as I find not in my realm, any but people as beaſtes, and without vnderſtanding, I haue therefore deſtroied their bloud, and ſo will I doe thine, if thou canſt not aſſoil a ſophiſme that I ſhal make to thee. O thou man ſerpentine ſaid Hercules, thine elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, thy prudence, thy cruell ſworde, foule and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted with infinite homicides make me nothing abaſhed, ne diſcourage me: I ſeeke thée, and am come hither for to deſtroy thee. And I will aſſaile not onely one of thy ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſmes,
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:7118:173"/>
but as many as thou canſt thinke: and will that thou well know, that if by force of my wit, I aſſaile thy ſophiſmes, and fallacious argumentes, I will doe vnto thee like as thou wouldeſt doe to mee: and if it happen that thy ſcience may not ouercome mee, yet will I that that thou defend thee with armes, and that thou kéepe thy life as well as thou canſt, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>With theſe wordes the monſter made vnto Hercules ſeuen ſophiſmes one after another, all fallacious and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till: then when Hercules had giuen ſolution to one, the monſter replied by ſeuen argumentes. Yet Hercules that was full of philoſophie, and expert in all ſcience, aunſwered ſo ſubſtantially to all his fallacious argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, that hee ſette hm at a non-plus. And for this cauſe the poets faine that this Hydre had ſeuen heades, as it appeareth in the firſt tragedy of <hi>Seneca,</hi> and ſay that when Hercules hadde ſmitten off one of his heades, that ſeuen other heades came againe in the ſame place. In the end then, for to purſue this matter, when Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules had ſo diſputed againſt the ſerpent that hee yéelded him to Hercules, in ſuch wiſe as he wiſt not what to ſay. Hercules ſaid to him: Serpent inhumaine, wee haue fought long enough with the tongue. Take thy ſworde, I may no longer withhold my hand from ſmiting vppon thee, and aſſay if thou be as ſubtill in armes as thou art ſubtill in language. Poore foole, ſaid the ſerpent (which was full of pride) knoweſt not thou, that by my part ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine I haue infected all this countrey, and I wil this day drinke thy bloud, and deuour thy body, wherefore make good watch, and kéep thee well.</p>
                     <p>Without mo wordes Hercules enhaunſed his ſworde, for to haue ſmitten his aduerſary, but he could not ſo ſoon haſte him but the ſerpent gaue him firſt two ſtrokes, one with his ſword, and the other with his taile, wherewith he had almoſt ſmitten him down to the ground. Yet Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules abode ſtanding, &amp; with his ſword y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he had lifted vp
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:7118:173"/>
he ſmote the monſter vpon the helme with ſuch ſtrength that he al to fruſhed the helme, and made him a wound in his head. At this ſtroke that the Serpent felt, he was full of furie, and with his ſword ſmote Hercules the ſecond time vpon the helme, with ſo great might that the ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles and the fire flew out, and the helme was broken. Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules that neuer before hadde receiued ſo great a ſtroke, promiſed him that he would reuenge it, and ſmote him right angerly. Their ſtrokes were great and deadly, they ſmote eche other <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

But when fortune had enough cheriſhed them both, ſhe turned againſt the Serpent ſo earneſtly: that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter many ſtrokes Hercules ſmote his ſharp ſword within the helme into his head, and bare him downe dead vnto the earth.</p>
                     <p>Hercules had great ioy when he ſawe the monſter put to the foile, &amp; he went for to fetch the king of Lerna, with Deianira, and his folke, and brought them for to ſee the monſter. When he hadde ſhewed them the monſter, hée made a great fire and burned it, and made ſacrifice vnto the goddes. And by the fire hee conſumed the monſter Hydre. Wherefore there were giuen to him great and right high praiſes and thanks. And he was brought to the Citie of Lerne with great glory of Ladies and of gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women, which conueied him vnto the kings pallace ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging melodiouſly. Deianira the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ioyed greatly in the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant victorie of her noble huſband. When Hercules had abidden there a while, he departed and went to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, where Theſeus receiued him gloriouſly. Then Hercules and Athlas held ſchoole in Athens, foraſmuch as they of Athens were quicke of capacitie and of wit, and gaue themſelues all to learn ſcience: and there they were a great while introducing and enforming them of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens in philoſophy and in aſtronomie.

O noble vertuous man. When Hercules had ſpent ſome time there, and ſtudied ſo long that his doctrine had giuen light vnto the Athenians, hee departed from thence with great bemoning, and brought his wife vnto the citie of Licie. And then hee was ſo greatly renowmed, that from all the realmes of Greece there came dayly to him noble men and other, for to profit in vertue, in noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, in honour, in armes, in philoſophy, in aſtronomie, and in all other perfection, &amp;c.</p>

Gerion was the worſt of them all.

This Phyliſtines as <hi>Bocace</hi> rehearſeth in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogie of goddes, was ſon of Phenis, king of Phenycia. And this Phenis was ſonne of king Agenor, ſon of king Belus. Philiſtines then raigned in Galicia, and was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter named the Prieſt of Hercules, foraſmuch as when Hercules had vanquiſhed the tyrants of Heſperie, he fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded there a temple which he held after in great reuerence. Alway as Hercules peopled and inhabited this land, hee did cauſe to bee made pillers or columnes high and maruellous great, and ſet them vpon the ſea: and vppon euery piller or columne hee did make an image of hard ſtone, in the ſemblance and likeneſſe of a knight, like vnto Hercules all clad with the ſkin of a Lion. And there was one of the images that held a table wherein was written with letters of gold. <hi>Paſſe no further for to ſeeke land, ne go for to conquer further any realms in the Weſt, for thou ſhalt find no more land, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The noble Hercules went then into the countrey whereas ſtandeth now the citie of Siuil, which was not then founded, and found by his ſcience that there ſhoulde be builded a citie of great renowme: wherefore in memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie thereof, he ſet vp in that place a pillar of hard ſtones, and thereupon ſet an image holding in his hand written, that ſaid: <hi>That there ſhould be made one of the greateſt Cities in the world.</hi> This land of Galicia appertained to Gerion. But then when Hercules had made this pillar aboue-ſaid, and ſet it whereas now ſtandeth Siuill: hee had a great will for to begin to build the citie, for the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray was paſſing good &amp; commodious. But Athlas (by the ſcience of aſtronomy) counſelled him contrary, ſhewing him by certaine ſignes, that it was deſtinie, that another
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:7118:175"/>
ſhould make the citie. And therefore nigh the piller, he did make a columne of white marble, vpon which ſtoode the image of Hercules great &amp; rich, that held one hand againſt the Eaſt, wherin was written: <hi>Here hath been Hercules.</hi> And with the other hand he ſhewed the writing that the other image held.</p>
                     <p>Theſe thinges accompliſhed, Hercules departed from thence, and left to inhabite and keepe the countrey eight hundred men of his of the countrey of Scithia, that were ſtrong and expert in armes, and with good wil they abode there, becauſe the countrey was plentifull. Then went Hercules by the banks of the ſea, into the laſt and further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt part of Europe, and ſailed ſo farre that he entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the riuer of Guadiana, whereas the tyrant Gerion dwelled and abode in the Citie of Megidda. The ſame time that Hercules entered into the riuer: Gerion went vp to the top of an high towre, where he might ſee all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the countrey, for to eſpie if any perſon came, vppon whom he might exreciſe his tyrannie. He had not bin long there, when he beheld the riuer and ſaw the army of Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules: And ſeeing this armie, he had great ioy, for him ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med well that in all haſte hee ſhoulde ſubdue and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them. Without other delay hee aſſembled his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices, and ſownded to armes. Within a little while all his men that were ready and furniſhed with arms, came vnto him for to know what he would? when Gerion was all armed, and ready for to go and enter into the battaile, he declared to his people his intention, after he entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his gallies as haſtily as he might, and went from Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gidda approching toward the Gréeks. Thus rowing forth, it hapned him that he met a little boat: And from as farre as he ſawe it come, hee went againſt it and areſted it. In this boat were no mo then two mariners, &amp; Hiſpan. Geri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then called Hiſpan, and demanded of him whither hee went, &amp; what he was? Certes ſir, anſwered Hiſpan. I am a Greeke, &amp; haue intention to go to the king Gerion, that
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:7118:176"/>
is nowe in his city of Megidda, for to diſpatch a meſſage that I am charged with. Meſſenger (ſayd the king) if yée ſéeke Gerion, yee néed for to go no further forth: for I am he, whom ye ſpeake vnto. Sir (anſwered Hiſpan) ſince that you be he to whom my meſſage apperteineth, I let you haue knowledge in the name of the vertuous Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, that he is an enemy to your vices: and for to correct your great and abominable treſpaſſes and ſinnes, hée is come into your dominion. Meſſenger (anſwered Gerion) how is Hercules ſo preſumptuous as for to come vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me, to take vpon him to correct my vices? he wote litle with whom he hath to do: go to him, and tell him, that he ſhall not be let to find me, but it ſhall be too ſoone for his health, and that I will feaſt him in ſuch wiſe ere he eſcape mée, as I haue béene accuſtomed to feaſt ſtrangers.</p>
                     <p>Hiſpan departed with theſe words, and returned vnto Hercules as haſtily as he might, and tolde him worde for word what Gerion had ſayd vnto him: and moreouer hée ſayd, that he would méete with him right ſoone all prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and ready for to begin the battell. When Hiſpan had finiſhed his meſſage, the gallies of king Gerion appeared, and were ſéene from farre. Hercules and the Gréekes had great ioy, and began a right great ſhouting, in ſounding trumpets, fifes, and tabours. Gerion and his folke ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and hearing their enemies, they likewiſe beganne to ſhoute, and to make a marueilous great noyſe. The aire was then filled with a right great and ioyfull noiſe. In this vprore and outragious noyſe, the two hoſtes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proched eche other. At the approching was not ſpared darts, nor round ſtones, nor arrowes. They of Heſperie had great aboundance of daries, which they vſed and caſt on the Gréekes as it had béene raine. The cries redoubled on the one ſide and on the other, ſo that there were many dead and hurt. They were all men of warre: ech man bare him valiantly, and among all other, Hercules hauing the bowe in hand, ſlew as many of his en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="341" facs="tcp:7118:176"/>
The ſhot dured long. When it failed they fought hand to hand. Then beganne the battaile to be eagre and hard. Gerion ſhewed himſelfe a man boyſtrous and well expert in armes, and put to death many Greekes: but for one that he ſlew, Hercules ſlew ten of the Heſperiens, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>At the encounter that the Gallies made, there were many hurt, and ſtrokes giuen. Hercules tooke his clubbe and in ſmiting one of the Galies, that thought to haue grapled and borded his galley, hee ſtrooke with ſo great force, that he made it to cleaue aſunder, and that the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter came in ſo ſodainly that the moſt part of them that were in that galley were drowned, and periſhed without ſtroke ſmiting. After this, Hercules came to another galley, and there did he maruailes of armes: all they that he raught with his club were dead or ſore hurt. Some he ſmote the braines out of the head, and of other hee brake legges and armes. It ſeemed to thunder with him: hee did ſo beſtir him, that eche man fled from him: and there was no man that withſtoode him, or durſt abide him. When hee ſawe this, hee put himſelfe forth to exploite great affaires. He leapt from gally to gally, and made ſo great ſlaughters, that his people by his good example a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded in valour of courage and puiſſance, and the Heſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periens diminiſhed &amp; leſſened: and alſo they had ſo much damage, that all thinges went againſt them. And then Gerion, cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidering that he might not but loſe, and that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune was an enemy vnto him, he did ſound a retrait, and ſo left the battaile.</p>

he had encloſed the Gallies of Gerion, in ſuch wiſe that they might not returne into his Citie without paſſing by him. When the two armies were withdrawn, Gerion in the darkeſt of al the night, ſhipped &amp; went into the ſea, and went into the Citie of Valeritia, whereof one of his brethren was king, &amp; put him there in ſafetie, in purpoſe to make the greateſt army that he could to come vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules.

                        </gap> the city was well prouided with vittaile. Since they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted out of Greece, they found no where ſo good fortune. What ſhal I ſay? Hercules held him there a ſpace of time ſearching in what place he might finde Gerion. During theſe things, he went vnto the temple, for to thank y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gods. In this temple were many Sepultures garniſhed with right faire maruellous hiſtories. Among all other there was one paſſing riche: for the remembrance of Gerion was there, as of a king of fine gold, and he was enuironed with 30 kings, whoſe heads were ſmitte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> off. Hercules a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode at this ſepulture, and demaunded of the Citizens wherefore ſerued the ſtatues &amp; images ſo rich. A citizen ſaid to him, that there were the ſepultures of the noble men of their realm, and that the king Gerion had brought vp that cuſtome to make theſe Sepultures, for to haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of them that were valiant in arms. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more (ſaid that ſame man) as ſoone as in this countrey a

When Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules heard this that the Citizen ſaid, he anſwered, that he held himſelfe happy, that he had eſcaped the ſword of ſuch a tyrant, that put ſo many kings to death, and made his Oriſons, &amp; his praiers vnto the gods: After this he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the pallace, and there came vnto him the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger of king Gerion, that by the power of his maiſter commanded him to void the city, and the realm, or els to make good watch. Hercules anſwered, that he was entred into the realm, &amp; alſo into the citie with ſtrength of armes and that he would not go out therof vntil y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time that one had taken from him his ſword and arms, by force of arms, or vntil the time that he put the countrey in obeyſance.</p>
                     <p>The meſſenger returned from Megidda with this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere vnto Gerion, and told him what Hercules had an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him. Gerion was with his two brethren: they tooke the words of Hercules impatiently, and ſware that they would auenge them of him. To make ſhort worke: they went to the ſea with a great army of men of armes. They rowed and ſailed with all the ſtrength they might vnto Megidda: the winde and fortune ſuffered them in few daies to come and arriue at the port of Megidda: And Hercules was aduertiſed of their comming, who ſuffered the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to take land, and let them reſt that day that they came there: they were fiftie thouſand men. At that time that they came a land it was late. When they ſawe that the Greekes made no defence at their landing, they ſaid one to another, that they durſt not come and fight with them. And weening all to haue wonne aduantage, they thereupon concluded that on the morrowe they woulde aſſaile the Citie right early. Vppon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, Gerion and his brethren purueied them of
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:7118:178"/>
things appertaining to the aſſault, and menaced greatly Hercules and his Greeks for to ſlea them villanouſly. Hercules and his Greekes were then in Megidda, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king on their affaires, not only in the intention for to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them from their enemies, but for to iſſue out the next day following, and for to aſſaile them by battaile, aſſoone as the night were paſſed. Then a little before the ſun ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, on the morrow, Hercules made two battails. In the firſt, hee put a thouſand fighting men, and enterpriſed to conduct them. In the ſecond hee put the reſidue of his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, and made Theſeus captain of them. After this, when he hadde right well trained his people, and ſet them in a right good order, he admoniſhed them to doe well their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoire, and had in minde to ſay to them certain things, but he might not finiſh his ſpéech: for that ſame time Gerion and his brethren, &amp; their folk, made their approches to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile the citie, and made ſo great a hurly burly and noiſe, that all about it redounded, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>When Hercules heard this vproare, he did prepare ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gate, for to behold &amp; ſée what new thing was there. And at the iſſuing out he ſaw his enemies that haſted them to come to the forts and walles with ladders and other En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines fit and neceſſary to make an aſſault. Then hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to laugh in himſelfe, and bad his men to follow him: and he went ſtraightway forth for to begin the ſkirmiſh. And aſſoone as the porter had opened the gates, Hercules marched vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Heſperiens bringing his club with him. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Gerion ſaw Hercules come from far, he knew him, by his ſkin of the Lyon, and by his club, and ſhewed him to his brethren, that maruelled of him, becauſe he came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone vpon them. Luther is our mortal aduerſary, ſaid Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion: he is full of pride, and ſetteth little by vs: Let vs aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile him al three, and deſtroy him: it is time: al the gold of the world ſhal not ſaue him. Hercules with theſe wordes came ſo nigh the three giantes, that he might well ſpeake vnto them, and cried vnto them and ſaide: yee euill

tyrants, lay downe your engines apperteining to aſſault: it is now no time to aſſaile the citie, but it behooueth you to diſpoſe you to enter into battell. The battell is ready, beginne at me, and I at you, and let vs ſight together till more come. With theſe words he lifted his club, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged the ſtroke ſo ſore vppon one of the thrée brethren, that he caſt his ſhielde before the ſtroke, and all aſtonied he bare him to the earth. When Gerion &amp; his other bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſawe their brother ſo borne downe and beaten, they ſmote with their ſwords vpon Hercules with great fury, and ſo imployed their ſtrength, that they brake part of his armes. With theſe two ſtrokes of their ſwords, Hercules receiued more then an hundred dartes vppon his body: howbeit the ſwordes nor the darts were not ſo hard tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered, that they could pearce, enter, ne hurt the armes of Hercules, ne Hercules left not to worke with his clubbe: but he it lift vp on high at that time, and ſtrak it vpon the ſecond brother of Gerion ſo luſtily, that downe from the top of the helme, he all to cruſhed and bruiſed him, &amp; ſmote him downe to the ground, like as an hard and great rock<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Gerion was all afrayde for to ſée ſo great a ſtroke, and with a wonderfull angry and fierce heate, he layde vpon Hercules, and gaue him ſo great a ſtroke vpon the helme with his ſword, that he made the fire ſpring out: but the helme was ſo hard, that the ſword might not enter. Then was Hercules enuironed with his enemies, and was ſmitten in many a place vpon his body. The Heſperians deſired ſore to ſée their ſwordes and glaiues red with the bloud of Hercules, but Hercules put himſelfe to defence, ioyous for that he might employ his ſtrength vpon them. And when he prooued him thus vpon one and other, and would ſuffer none come néerer then his arme and clubbe might reach, and that his enemies more and more came about him, Malion, that was nephew to Vliſſes, iſſued out of Megidda with a thouſand men of the army of Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:7118:179"/>
And ſéeing ſo great a company of people about Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules, and was aſſured that he fought there, hee and his people addreſſed themſelues thitherward, making ſo great a crie, and ſetting on ſo valiantly, that in bearing downe all afore them, they came and founde Hercules, that he had ſlaine more then ſixe hundred of his enemies, and that he feared yet nothing. They that bare ladders and other engines, were conſtrained to caſt them downe to the ground, and to goe to the battell. The battell was there grieuous and hard: and there were many knightes ſlaine. Gerion beſtirred himſelfe terribly. His brother that was firſt beaten, after that he was borne out of the preaſe, came vnto the field againe, and in his comming he made a great roome among the Gréeks: he was ſtrong and puiſſant, and bare a right heauie guiſarme, the edge of which was thrée great foot long: he did maruailes with this guiſarme, and beate downe ſo many of the Gréekes, that the noiſe aroſe greatly about him. And this noyſe came to the eares of Hercules. Then left Hercules them that he fought with, and drew to the noiſe that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céeded by the cauſe of the giant. Aſſoone as he ſaw the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, that deall with the Gréekes as he would, he was not well content with that guiſarme: and hee lifted vp his clubbe, and ſmote the giant vpon the ſhoulder, employing his ſtrength in ſuch maner, that the ſhoulder and the ſide hee all to brake, and bare him downe to the grounde, not fully dead, but in worſe eſtate then dead, for he might not relieue himſelfe, and muſt néedes die vnder the féet of the men of armes right miſerably.</p>

Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules, Theſeus and Hiſpan, with about twelue hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Greekes followed them ſwiftly: they entered into ſome of their ſhips, and purſued Gerion, but they had not marriners ſo ready as the other had, wherefore they were a little letted.

Hercules on the other ſide, ſailed and rowed after Gerion. Gerion perceiued him, and was ſore afraid and fled all that euer he might. The flight du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red three daies.

The Heſperiens caſt vpon Hercules then round ſtones, dartes with ſharp yrons on the end, ſpeares and ſwordes. Againſt this the Greekes tooke their ſhieldes, and couered them, and put them in deuoire for to winne the port. But the caſting of the Heſperiens was ſo mortall, that it conſtrained their enemies to abide, and not approche the porte. They had at this port great aboundance of ſtones. The Heſperiens kept well the entry more then three houres, ſo that the
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:7118:180"/>
Greeks coulde finde no way nor meane to remedy it. At the end of three houres, Hercules right ſorrowfull to ſee his men troubled ſo, thought he would enter into a little boat, and aduenture himſelfe alone to win the port. Then he that doubted no ſtroke of any mortall man, entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the little boate, and ſteared it himſelfe, with helpe of the winde which he had at his aduauntage, and hoiſed vp the ſaile, and putting all in aduenture, as faſt as he might he brought the boate vnto the port, whither hee came by his hardineſſe. But this was at ſuch time as he receiued more then a thouſand ſtrokes with ſtones: and that his ſaile that ſtood ouer end by force of the winde, was ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten full of holes, and the cordes broken, and the maſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowne, and the boate well nigh filled with ſtones. Notwithſtanding all theſe thinges, Hercules ceaſſed not at all from his enterpriſe, but through he paſſed by al the ſtrokes of his enemies. He laboured ſo that hee tooke land, and that he thruſt himſelfe among the Heſperiens: and there he began to ſmite with his clubbe, on the right ſide, and on the left ſide endlong and ouerthwart, with ſuch aboundance of proweſſe, that all the place was red with their bloud and with their braines. Theſeus and Hiſpan, and fiftie of the Greekes beſt armed, by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Hercules, tooke a light boat and aduentured themſelues to winne the porte. Hercules was euen at the mouth of the porte: he ſaw Theſeus come, and for to make him haue paſſage, he ran hither and thither, and did ſo great hurt to the Heſperiens, that without great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, they tooke land, and ſprang out of the boate. Then was the aſſault hote and furious. Gerion came to the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Theſeus and fully three hundred of his men that followed him. All they ſmote and layd vpon the Greeks, and of the fiftie they ſlew ten. When Theſeus and Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan ſaw that, their heartes began to ſwell. They encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged themſelues, and pierſed the aſſembly of Gerion: and againſt one man that was ſlaine of theirs, they ſlew
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:7118:181"/>
fiftie of the Heſperians. And there they vſed ſo their prow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſes, that they did there the greateſt marueiles of the world by armes.</p>
                     <p>Gerion died for ſorrow that he might not come to haue his will on the Gréekes: hee and his men were eager as Tygres that had béene famiſhed. The Gréekes were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mighty and ſtrong as Elephants: their ſtrokes were great, they doubted neither death nor ſworde, but put all in aduenture. The battell was ſtrong, and the Gréekes receiued many a wound: alway Theſeus and Hiſpan by their marueilous proweſſes ſaued them from the death, and made paſſage thorow a great preaſe where Hercules was. Hercules that left not to ſmite was very glad when he ſaw Theſeus and Hiſpan, and their forty companions. Their comming coſt Gerion the death of a thouſand men &amp; more: for Hercules, for to encourage his men, and for to be to them an example of well doing, he added to his déeds ſtrength vpon ſtrength, and proweſſe vpon proweſſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding his enemies ſo dreadfully and terribly, drawing them toward the ſea, that they that ſaw him, wiſhed that they had bin in their mothers wombs: and in flying they were in ſuch haſte, &amp; ſo diſtreſſed, that they beat ech other into the ſea, and ſo they ſlew ech other themſelues. Then was Gerion ſmitten to the heart with great ire, medled with impatience: ſo hee put himſelfe in the preaſe, and ſmote not only vpon Hercules, but alſo vpon the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of Theſeus: he ſmote the firſt man vpon the helm, ſo that he cleft his head vnto the téeth. After he aſſailed another, and bare him to the earth ſo aſtonied, that he wiſt not where he was. Conſequently, he made there a great aſſault ſuddenly on the Gréekes, ſo that he died his ſword with their bloud, and that the Gréekes were conſtrained to make a huge great crie, for to haue ſuccours.</p>
                     <p>At this ſeaſon the Gréeks, that were left in the gallies, entred into the port, and tooke land eaſily. When Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les and his folke heard the crie that his men made, he ran
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:7118:181"/>
thither to the aſſault, and made about them a newe noiſe great &amp; pitious. Gerion knew anon, that the noiſe came becauſe of Hercules: For he ſaw him come and ſmite in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thickeſt of the preaſe, for to ſaue himſelfe: then he called to his folke and chéered them in encouraging, and had there ſo great miſhap, that for one ſtroke that Hercules gaue him with his club by chance he was conſtrained to depart from the preaſe, &amp; to withdraw him apart with them that were weary, &amp; for to take his breath. Gerion afterward fought to his extremitie, and caſting ſo his eies vppon the ſkirmiſh and fighting, he ſaw the Greeks vpon the port, &amp; prouiding them vnto the battaile. After he ſaw how they put many of his men to the worſt, and that hee might not reſiſt it: al his loſſes came before his eyes, and then he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſigh, and ſaid, with a dolorous heart: alas, what is the mutabilitie of fortune? Flattering fortune, what haſt thou thought? All the honor that thou haſt giuen me here before, redound now to my ſhame, ſince thou haſt ſent and parted to me ſo many goodes, wherefore haſt thou ſent to me Hercules? this is the enemy of all my glory no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

O what great miſhap is this: ſince it muſt needes be that I ſhalbe vnfortunate, I will verily die of the club that I haue ſeene my brother die with: or I will take vengeance. Gerion all out of his wit with theſe wordes put him in the preaſe, crying: Gerion, Gerion, for to make his men to courage the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues. Thus crying &amp; ſeeking Hercules, he put to death many Gréeks: he was al furious, ſo as his ſword was died with the blood of his enemies. In the end he came vnto Hercules, &amp; with his ſword ſo died, he ſmote him ſore. Hercules was weary, for without ceaſſing, hee abode fighting by the ſpace of 4. houres, and had receiued vpon his arms ſo many ſtrokes,
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:7118:182"/>
that no man could number them. This notwithſtanding, hee fledde not at all from Gerion: but came to him ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and fought againſt him with ſo great force, that all they that ſaw it maruelled: and after many ſtrokes ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of Gerion and Hercules, Hercules ſmote him one ſtroke, ſo great that he al to bruſed Gerion, and beate out the braines of his head, and ſmote the helme vppon his ſhoulders, ſo that he fell down dead among the dead men, in ſuch wiſe mangled that he abode there dead.</p>

When the Heſperiens ſaw him brought to that paſſe, as for to taſte the bitter morſel of death, all left their armes. All they bewailed ſorrowfully the death of Gerion, and fell all in deſpaire: So that one ſtaied ſtill to be ſlaine, other fled by deſartes, by moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, by the bankes of the Sea, and turned all backe in diſcomfiture. When Hercules had eſpied them ſo diſraied, he thanked the Goddes, and began for to purſue his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. The purſuite dured vnto the Euen. The Greekes filled the fieldes, the mountaines and the waies by the Sea, with the bloud of them that fled. When the night was come, Hercules and the Greeks withdrew them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Gallies, and did eate, and drinke ſuch as they had, and made ioyfull cheere. The hurt men were remembred and comforted with the victory and ſpoile. The wearie men forgat the labour that they had done. They reſted them after their trauaile, &amp; paſſed the night ouer.

Hee ſent vnto all places where he wiſt that any people were thereaboutes, and gaue to each man in knowledge, that hee was minded to make a citie there, and that the firſt perſon that woulde come to put hand thereto, ſhoulde haue the gouernment thereof. This thing was knowne in all Galicia. Manie came thither, but a woman named Corogne was the firſt that came. And therefore Hercules gaue vnto her the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling therof, and made to begin the citie, and named it Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogne, in remembraunce of the victory that hee had there. Vpon the body of Gerion he founded a towre, and by his art compoſed and made a lampe burning continually day and night, without putting of any thing thereto. Which burned afterward by the ſpace of 300. yere. Moreouer vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the pinacle or top of the towre: hee made an image of copper looking into the ſea, and gaue him in his hand a looking glaſſe hauing ſuch vertue, that if it happened that any men of warre were on the ſea meaning to doe anie harme to the city, ſodainly their army and their comming ſhould appeare in this ſaid looking glaſſe: and that dured vnto the time of Nabuchodonozor: who being aduertiſed of the propertie of the glaſſe, filled his gallies with white things &amp; greene, bowes and leaues, that it ſeemed a wood, and in the looking glaſſe appeared none other thing but a wood: Whereby the Corogniens not knowing of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing then their glaſſe ſhewed to them, furniſhed not them with men of armes, like as they had been accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to do when their enemies came: And thus Nabucho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donozor tooke the citie in a morning and deſtroied the loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king glaſſe and the lampe.

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter this conqueſt, as Hercules intended to people and inhabite this new country, tidinges came to him that in the Citie of Cartagene, a king &amp; giant raigned, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Cacus, which was paſſing euil, &amp; ful of tyranny, and had ſlaine by his curſed dealing the kings of Aragon and of Nauarre, their wiues and their children, and poſſeſſed their ſeignories, and alſo held in ſubiection all the countrey of Italy. Hercules re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued right ioyouſly theſe tidinges, and ſaid, that by the pleaſure of the Gods, hee will aſſay if hee may take ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of the death of the kinges of Arragon and of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarre. Then he diſpoſed him vnto this work, and hauing an appetite to correct the king Cacus, as ſoone as his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie might be ready, he went vnto the realme of Caſtile, whereas was the king Cacus in the cittie of Cartagene, that ſtood beſide a mountaine named Monachaio. And hee paſſed by many realmes that did him obeiſance, for his vertuous renowme: but when hee came to approche to Cartagene, the king Cacus came againſt him without obeyſance, and in armes: for he had been aduertiſed of his comming. And as hee entred into the frontiers, hee ſent vnto him one of his knights, that ſaid to him theſe words that follow: Hercules thou open tyraunt, that haſt thine heart greater then thy body, and that wouldeſt aſſaile the heauens, for to conquer them, if the Gods had giuen thee winges for to flie as the birdes haue: If thou ſeeke peace and loue vnto the king Cacus, thy equall in condition and fortune, I ſalute thee in his name: and if thou come

otherwiſe to him as his enemy, I defie thée in his name. And in no wiſe be thou ſo hardy as to enter into his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. And if thou enter, know thou that thou ſhalt find in Cacus and in the Caſtiliens ſo hard an encounter, that from thy euill aduenture ſhall no man of thy company bée quit, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Knight (aunſwered Hercules) whatſoeuer you bee, you ſhewe not that you haue the heart of a noble man. For it is a ſhame to all men, and eſpecially to a noble man, to miſſay or ſpeake euill of another man. Ye haue called me an open tyrant: and alſo ye haue compared mee vnto the tyrant Cacus. I anſwere you to this article, that I am no tyrant: but a deſtroier of tyrantes: and therefore yee ſhall returne againe vnto Cacus, and ſignifie to him, that I haue intention for to ſhew what hate I haue vnto tyrantes: and that within few daies he may prooue vpon me the hard encounter, whereof I haue now receiued the menaces. With this aunſwere the Caſtilien departed from the preſence of Hercules, and returned vnto the king Cacus, and tolde him worde for worde what Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules had ſaide to him. When Cacus had heard all this: he was abaſhed, notwithſtanding that hee was a ſtrong Giant and a puiſſant, and that he had neuer found a man ſtronger then he was himſelfe: for the renowme of Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules was then ſo great through the vniuerſall worlde, that the moſt ſtrong, and the moſt aſſured in armes, and moſt fortunate doubted him, and trembled hearing him ſpeake of his deedes.

Nowe it behoueth that Caſtile and Sicille ſhew the force of their armes, for to defend the king Cacus from the clawes of his enemies: and it is of neceſſitie likewiſe that the king Cacus, for his people diſplay, and put forth the vttermoſt of his ſtrength.
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:7118:184"/>
Now go we on my brethren and friends, wee be come to the warre. The Greeks come vpon Caſtile without any quarrell, let vs go againſt them and fight for our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey: the birdes fight one againſt the other for their neſts, and the dumbe beaſtes for their caues. Nature leadeth them ſo for to doe. If we haue the ſame nature: the time is come that we ought to ſhew it, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>When the Caſtiliens and the Aragonnoys that were there, heard Cacus ſo ſpeake, they praiſed greatly his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and anſwered all with one voice, that they were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to aſſaile their enemies. With this anſwere the king did diſlodge his hoaſt that he had there in the fieldes: and went forth againſt Hercules, the ſtraiteſt way that hee could. The king Cacus then went on the way deſiring ſore to finde Hercules. Hercules on the other ſide came then againſt Cacus. They went ſo long the one againſt the other, that ſoone after they ſawe each other, nigh a place where Hercules founded after a citie, which was named Terracene. Aſſoone as they ſawe each other, they began to make great ioy, and to make ſhoutes and cries. After they trained them in order of battaile, and marched the one againſt the other ſo hotely and ſharply, that they filled the aire in ſhort ſpace with ſhot of arrowes, caſting of ſtones, and of dartes. At the beginning of this battaile the Caſtiliens bare them valiantly, and there were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of their part ſlaine, more by hardineſſe then for dread. For they put themſelues too farre forth. And they doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not the ſhot of the Greekes, that ſhot on them ſo ſore, and ſo thicke, that al the ground was made red with their bloud. And the Caſtiliens which were ſo farre gone and ſore chafed were driuen to reſorte backe againe to their fellowes. When king Cacus ſawe his folke ſo ſore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead, and heard that they reculed from the ſhotte of the Gréekes, he hadde great ſorrow in his heart, and wiſt not what to doe for to entertaine and holde his battaile. Some fledde, and other reculed and went backe, and
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:7118:184"/>
other fell downe to the earth dead or ſore hurt. The bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile dured long in this point, alway to the ſorrow of king Cacus. But in the end the ſhot of the Gréekes failed, and the Caſtilians with Cacus recouered new ſtrength, in ſuch ſort, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they came to fight hand to hand with ſwordes, and that they ſhed and ſpread largely the bloud of them of Tyre and of Ancone which were in the firſt front of the battaile of Hercules.</p>
                     <p>The noiſe aroſe great there: there were many ſhields broken and ſkinnes of Lyons cut in peeces. There as Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus approched, it ſeemed that the tempeſt was: he was great, ſtrong, and fierce and outragious in ſmiting: eche of his ſtrokes was the death of a Greeke. In the end, hee did ſo much that the cries of them that were about him mounted ſo high in the aire, that the Caſtiliens had well weend to haue woon all, and beganne to make ioy for their good fortune in chaſing the Greeks to the death: but euen in like wiſe as a right cleere day is other while tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by a darke black cloud: ſo by the alone comming of Hercules that came then to the ſkirmiſh, all their ioy was troubled and turned into mortal loſſe. For the deadly arm of Hercules layd about him then ſo terribly that hee beate downe the Caſtiliens, like as a mower with a ſithe cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth downe the graſſe in a medowe. When Cacus ſawe Hercules ſo foundre and beate downe his men, all the bloud in him chaunged. Then his bloud ſo mooued, as a couragious man he preſented himſelf before the front of Hercules, and ſmote him with his ſword ſo ſore and hard, that he cleft his ſhield in two partes. The Caſtiliens ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſhield of Hercules flie by peeces, thought anon that Cacus had ſlaine and put to death Hercules, and then made a cry for ioy, but it dure<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> not long: for Hercules lift vp his armes with his club, and ſmote Cacus vppon the top of his helme with ſuch ſtrength, that it ſeemed to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus that he ſaw an hundred thouſand candles, or that he had been ſmitten down with the greateſt rock of Spaine.
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:7118:185"/>
This notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding Cacus abode ſtanding in his place, and chalenged Hercules to death, and ſmote him with all his might. At this aſſailing, the Caſtiliens hoping in the fortune of Cacus, al they aſſailed Hercules. Hercules was gone ſo farre among his enemies, that he was alone from all his company. When hee heard that Cacus threatned him to death, and ſawe that the Caſtiliens aſſailed him &amp; came to him from al ſides, he had his heart all filled with ſolace, and abandoned the thickneſſe and hardneſſe of his ſkinne of the lion to the ſwordes of them all, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenging him ſaue only againſt Cacus. Thus began the battaile betweene Hercules and Cacus: the ſtrokes were great and fearefull without meaſure. Cacus fought in the ſpirite of a tyraunt chafed, and deſired ſore to ouercome Hercules for to tyranniſe and triumph ouer him. Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules fought in a vertuous heart, founded and nouriſhed in vertue, and as an enemy of vice, hee aſſailed this viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous king. Both two were great, fearce, and ſtrong, of great courage. But certes when they hadde both taſted e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough each other, at length the ſtrokes of Hercules were ſo great and ſo forcible, that the ſhoulders of Cacus nor his head might not beare, nor had the might to ſuſtaine them. So the end was ſuch, that after their battaile had dured two houres, Cacus left him: for hee might no more ſuffer him, but fled and went his way, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>When Hercules ſaw that Cacus fled, hee meant not to follow after. This notwithſtanding, for to haue the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory in this battell, hee began to hew on the Caſtiliens, Arragonoys, and ſuch other as he might finde: for he left no man aliue, before him yong nor old, féeble nor ſtrong. Hiſpan &amp; the other of his ſide, made their feates of armes to flouriſh and ſhine. The battel was ſharp: for then the Greeks doubled &amp; redoubled their ſtrokes, and ſlew manie of their enemies. In the end when Cacus had taken his breth, he put him again into the middle at one ſide, where his folk fled, &amp; made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to tary, ſmiting and beating the
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:7118:185"/>
Gréekes more terribly then he had done before, whereof the cries aroſe ſo high there, that Hercules then ſighting on another ſide, heard the cry, and then hee ran thither at all aduenture. And anon as he ſpied Cacus, hee went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and brake the preaſe, and ſmote downe ſo ſore, that Cacus knew Hercules, but hee durſt not abide him, but fled againe with euill hap. And then the Greeks made a cry and a ioyfull noyſe, ſo that all the Caſtiliens fledde, ſome heere and ſome there to the great hurt and loſſe of Cacus. For of all his people there was left no more but 50 which ſaued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues vpon the mount of Monchayo which ſtoode thereby. But that was with great effuſion of bloud of them of Caſtile, that thought to haue mounted vp with the other, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it ſéemed that there had been a great ſpring of bloud, that the caues in the valley were repleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with bloud, howbeit Cacus for to flie wel, ſaued him ſelfe and fiftie of his men vppon the mountaines, as the chronicles of Spaine rehearſe. When he was aboue, and in ſure peace, he returned and looked downe to the foot of the hill, and he ſaw there ſo many Caſtiliens, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out number were dead, or in daunger for to die: hee hadde great ſorrowe then at his heart, not for pitie, but for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite, and for the danger that he ſawe ready whereby hee muſt paſſe. Anon after he ſawe from farre in the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paigne and each quarter and place there all couered with them of his part and of their bloud. Alſo he ſaw them that fled taken and brought to the handes of the other. Theſe things conſidered, the deſolation of his dominion and the puniſhment of his tyranny was to him euident: he thoght then that Hercules would ſoone conquere all the country: For they obeied him for his tyranny, and not for naturall loue. This notwithſtanding he diſpaired not, albeit that he ſaw all the puiſſance of his men deſtroied by the clubbe of Hercules, and knewe that hee might no more reigne in that countrey, for all were ſlaine in the battaile, and then hee returned vnto his Science. And thus as

ſorrowfull as he was he entered into a houſe that he had there. But firſt appointed twelue of his men to keepe the paſſage of this mount, which was ſo ſtraite and narrowe that there might go vp but one man at once.</p>
                     <p>When then Hercules and his men had put to death all their enemies, Hercules began to aſſaile the rocke, and to mount, and go vppon the degrees or ſtaires: but then ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly they that kept the paſſe, caſt vppon him great ſtones, in ſo great aboundance that of force hee was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to deſcend. When Hercules ſawe that hee muſt withdraw him, he obeied fortune, but notwithſtanding he made there a vowe that hee would neuer depart from the foot of the rocke vnto the time that he had conſtrained Cacus to deſcend &amp; rome downe by famine or otherwiſe. This vow made, Hercules came vnto the foote of the hil, where battell and ſlaughter had been, and made the place to bee made cleane and purged of the dead bodies and of the bloud of them that there lay dead. After hee did make his tent of dewes and leaues, and his bed of freſhe graſſe, and commaunded that each man ſhoulde lodge there. At that time the night came and the day fayled, the Greeks were weary for that they had all day laboured in armes, and woulde faine haue reſt, and made good cheere with that they had. And after that they had ordeined and ſet their watche, aſwel for to keepe the coaſt, as for to keepe the rocke, that Cacus ſhould not come downe, they layd them downe vpon the graſſe, in ſuch wiſe as they were accuſtomed, when they were in war, and ſo ſlept and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that night.</p>
                     <p>On the morrow Hercules parted the hoaſt in twaine, and ſent Hiſpan with one of them into Arragon and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarre, and hee abode there with the other. Hiſpan in the name of Hercules was ioyfully receiued of the Nauar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roys and of the Arragonoys. And they made to him all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyſance, acknowledging Hercules to be their Lord, and the moſt vertuous prince that was in the Weſt. When
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:7118:186"/>
Hiſpan had all ſubdued as is ſaid, hee returned vnto Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules. Hercules lay yet ſtill before Monchaio, and there held Cacus in ſuch ſubiection that he might not iſſue. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus and his folke were then in great want of vittaile, and they wiſt not what to eate nor to drinke. They deferred as long as they might, hoping that Hercules woulde bée weary to be there ſo long. But in the end when their vit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile failed, and they ſaw that they mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>t néeds aduenture themſelues to come downe, Cacus by his ſcience made certaine ſecret things to go downe into their ſtomackes, and after put thereto the fire and taught all the other to do ſo: and then ſodainly as they felt the fire iſſue out of their mouthes, and the fume and ſmoke in ſuch aboundance that it ſeemed all on a light fire; then by the counſaile of Cacus, they aduentured themſelues to deſcend downe in running and caſting fire and fume ſo impetouſly, that Hercules and the Greeks thought that it had been a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt of lightning of the heauen, and had burnt the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine: ſo they made him place, for it was a thing for to make men ſore abaſhed: and thus they eſcaped the daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Hercules at that time. For during all that day the rocke was full of ſmoke and fume that Cacus had made, and the ſmoke was ſo material, that it ſéemed darknes.</p>
                     <p>When Cacus and his folk were thus eſcaped, and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the hoſte of Hercules and of the Greekes, Hercules was then the moſt wiſe clerk that was in the world: and all his paſtimes hee emploied in ſtudy: hee tooke his bookes, and began to muſe howe and by what reaſon hée was deſcended from the rocke: he read and turned many leaues, but all thing well conſidered hee found not that this fume came of naturall thinges: wherof he had great maruel. Then he ſent for Athlas that alway was lodged behinde the hoſte, for to be ſolitary. When Athlas was come, he ſhewed him the ſmoke and fume that yet dured. Then he told of the lightning y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was paſſed by the hoſte, and demaunded of him his opinion. Athlas knew incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:7118:187"/>
the fume, and anſwered to Hercules. Certes my ſonne, thou art more ſharpe in ſcience then I, for mine age may not attaine to ſo high things as thy youth. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, foraſmuch as I know the growing of this thing long time paſt: I will tell thee (that I ſhal ſay, thou ſhalt find true as I ſuppoſe). Thou ſhalt vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that this fume is a thing artificiall and made by the craft of Vulcan that was father of Cacus, which was an excellent maiſter in this ſcience, and was the inuenter thereof: he made cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine mountaines in Cicille to burne, and ſhall alway continually burne vnto the end of the worlde. Cacus, which can the arte and craft of his father, hath made this fume, and for to eſcape from thy handes, hee is deſcended with his companie in the forme of lightening or tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt, and thus thy ſtrength is deceiued by his Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
                     <p>When Hercules vnderſtood this that Athlas had ſaid to him, hee greatly maruelled of the ſcience of Cacus, and might not beleeue it. Then for to know the trueth, he tooke his clubbe, and went vp through the ſmoke or fume, vnto the top of the rocke, ſeeking Cacus: but hee found there neither beaſt nor man: then he returned vnto Athlas, and laughing, confeſſed to him that hee had ſaide trueth, and ſaide that he woulde make no purſuite after him, forſomuch as hee was ſo gentleman-like eſcaped. This day they paſſed ouer in ſpeaking and communing of Cacus and of his father Vulcan. The day following when the ſmoke and fume was gone and vaniſhed away, Hercules began to behold the country, and ſawe that it was commodious and fertile, and to the end that there ſhoulde euer be remembraunce and memory of him, hee founded there a citie, which he named Terracone, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as he gaue this countrey to the ſonne of the king of Ancone, and there hee made him dwell with his people and with them of Tyre. Hercules after this foundation, went to the cittie of Salamanque, and foraſmuch as it
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:7118:187"/>
was wel inhabited and peopled, hee would make there a ſolemne ſtudy, and did make there in the earth a great round hole in maner of a ſtudie, and hee ſette therein the ſeuen ſciences liberall with many other bookes. After he made them of the countrey to come thither for to ſtudy, but they were ſo rude and dull, that their wittes coulde not compriſe any cunning of ſcience. And then foraſmuch as Hercules woulde depart on his voiage, and woulde alſo that this ſtudy were maintained, he did make an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage or ſtatue of gold vnto his ſemblance and likeneſſe: Which hee did ſet vp on high in the middeſt of his ſtudie vpon a piller: and made ſo by his crafte and arte, that all they that came before this image for to haue declaration of any ſcience, to all purpoſes, and of all ſciences the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage anſwered, inſtructed, and taught the ſchollers and ſtudentes, in ſuch wiſe as it hadde been Hercules in his proper perſon. The renowme of this ſtudie was great in all the countrey. And this ſtudie dured after the time that ſaint Iames conuerted Spaine vnto the chriſtian faith. From Salamanque Hercules departed and went into Catalogne, and founded there the citie of Barſeloigne, which is a right good citie. And finally when he hadde ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed all theſe thinges, he ſent Athlas home againe into his countrey, but he held by him all his writers, for he loued bookes aboue all the riches of the world. After he woulde giue leaue vnto Phylotes for to returne vnto his countrey. But Phylotes refuſed his congie and leaue, and ſaid to him that he would ſerue him all his life, and that hee reputed his felicitie more great to be in his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, then for to gouerne the countrey that fortune hadde put in his hand. Hercules after this, called Hiſpan, and ſaid to him: Hiſpan, I know thy wit and thy va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance. I haue found thée alway wiſe and true. Thou art a man of authoritie and well knowne in theſe Coaſtes. I do now make and conſtitute thee to be king ouer all this Countrey, and I doe giue vnto thee

But Hercules ſaid to him, that he would that it ſhould be ſo, and deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to him a certain number of people of his company for to ſerue him.

When then they knew that Hercules approched their citie, anon they aſſembled their councell together, and demanded the one the other, if they ſhould ſuffer Hercules for to enter into their citie? All were of one opinion; that they ſhould not receiue him, and that they woulde ſende vnto him one of them, which was named Neſtor, that he ſhould not enter into Cremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, vnleſſe he firſt had vanquiſhed in battell the eleuen brethren. Neſtor at the commandement of the giants de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from Cremona, and went to Hercules, whome he found with his litle armie but thrée mile from Cremona. Then ſpake he to Hercules, and ſayde vnto him. Sir, I haue ten brethren kings of Cremona, that haue ſent mée vnto thée, foraſmuch as they be aduertiſed that thou en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſt into their dominion, and they charge thée by me, that they will giue vnto thée no paſſage into Cremona, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe thou firſt ouercome them one after another in battel: and therefore chooſe whether thou wilt haue the battell, or els to returne againe, and leaue this voyage. I aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe thée that they be all giants more great and more puiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant then I am. Sir knight, anſwered Hercules, I haue taken my way for to paſſe by Cremona: let the giants knowe that Hercules hath intention to ſpeake vnto them more neare, as he that dreadeth not nor feareth their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed tyrannies, which I muſt deliuer the world of, by feats of armes. And foraſmuch as to the end that they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume not that I haue any doubt or dread of them in any maner, yee ſhall ſay to them that I will not fight with them ten, one after another, but all at once together, and you with them, if you will accompany them: and for to do ſo, they ſhall finde me raedy to morow early, by day light.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="366" facs="tcp:7118:189"/>Hercules with theſe wordes made his people to abide, and reſt there for that night. And Neſtor returned to his brethren, and ſayd to them: My brethren, I haue ſpoken vnto Hercules, and haue tolde him your commandement: he hath anſwered vnto mee with a right high and plaine courage, that he will fight with vs to morrow, not one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another, but with vs all at once. And for to ſpeake plainely of him, he hath the ſemblance of a man to be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lourous in armes, and furniſhed with proweſſe: he is a prince very modeſt, and of great courage. Diſpoſe you well, it behoueth to furniſh well the battell. Certes the battell will be perillous, for hee is mightily membred, and as great as one of vs, but me thinketh that hee may not compare nor preuaile againſt vs eleuen, and that hee may not eſcape from our forces, but that wee ſhall pearce him with our ſwordes whatſoeuer force or ſtrength is in him. The giants ſo hearing him praiſe Hercules, had great maruaile of him, and might not beléeue Neſtor of that, that he had reported that he would fight with all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether at once, for there was none of them all, but hee thought himſelfe ſtrong enough for Hercules. Then they aſked of Neſtor, and demaunded of him if he were ſure to haue well vnderſtoode that Hercules ſayd vnto him, that he would fight againſt them all at once. Neſtor anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, yea, and that he had heard him ſay it in his proper perſon. With this aunſwere they concluded, that on the morrow they ſhould arme them all, and that they would goe to the field for to fight againſt Hercules, if he came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them. One of the giants ſayd then vnto his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, to morrowe ſhall be the day of our glory &amp; worſhip. Wee ſhall vanquiſh the vanquiſher of the monſters, let vs make good chéere. Brother (anſwered Neſtor) therein is no doubt but that wee ſhall ouercome and bring to the foile him that ye ſpeake of, but ſo much ſhall our glory be the leſſe, that we ſhall be eleuen againſt one. Well ſayd the other, if in fighting againſt vs eleuen, we ſhall haue
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:7118:189"/>
the leſſe honour, let vs euery man fight for himſelfe. Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, anſwered Neſtor, if ye had ſeene and heard him as I haue, ye would not be ſo hardy as ye ſhew ſemblance of: he is another maner of man then you wéene. Kéepe you at the offer that hee hath made, it is better to haue the moſt profite and leſſe honour in ſuch a caſe. In theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences they paſſed all that day, afterward they went to reſt. When the houre was come on the morrowe earely, they aroſe and made themſelues ready in the beſt wiſe they could. After they ſent one of their men vnto Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, for to know if he would ſay any thing: but aſſoone as the meſſenger iſſued out of the gate, the firſt thing he ſaw, was a giant, armed marueilouſly: the meſſenger abode then, and aduiſed him a little. After he had aduiſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, he went vnto the giant armed, &amp; aſked him what he was. I am Hercules, ſayd the giant. What will you ſay or haue, ſayde the meſſenger. I will ſay, ſayd Hercules, that the giants of Cremona haue no cauſe for to let mee the paſſage of their citie. And foraſmuch as they let me to vnderſtand yeſterday, that if I would haue paſſage, it behooued mee to vanquiſh them one after another in the fielde by battell: I am come hither in hope to winne the victorie: and demaund no other thing but for to ſee them in armes for to fight with them all together at once, to the end to haue the ſooner done. Wherefore I pray you to goe to them, and ſignifie vnto them my comming, and that they haſte them.</p>
                     <p>The meſſenger with theſe woordes returned vnto the giants, and tolde them all what he had found. When the giants knewe that Hercules was already come into the fielde, they all tooke their ſwoordes and their furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of warre, and departed from the citie, addreſſing themſelues againſt Hercules. Hercules was then alone in the place. The men and women of Cremona went vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the walles and towers for to ſee the battell. And Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotes with other noble men of the Gréekes were vpon an
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:7118:190"/>
hill farre enough from the place where Hercules was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding the giants. Certes, it was a faire ſight to ſée the comming of the eleuen giants. They were all well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed &amp; wel furniſhed with helmets inriched with gold and ſtones. They were great and ſtrong, all of one mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, they were bearded, and had fierce countenances: they came on and marched ſtoutly, and with a great cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage. When they came nigh to Hercules within halfe a bow ſhoot, they menaced him all to death, and made a crie ſo great that the walles of the citie redounded. After they ranne againſt the aſſured prince, like as they had béene ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Hercules hearing theſe cries, and ſéeing their courſe on foot, hee ſtayed for them, lifting vp his clubbe ouer his head. When it came to méeting, it ſéemed well that the giants would haue all to bruiſed him with their ſwordes, for they ſmote vpon him ſo vnmeaſurably, that the pieces of their ſwords flew into the ayre. Their ſtrokes were great. Hercules ſuffered them, and beheld what power they had: but when they had made their aſſaies vpon him, Hercules made his aſſay vpon them, and with his clubbe ſmote one of the giants vpon his helme, ſo that hee all to bruiſed not onely his helme, but alſo his head, that he fell downe ſuddenly dead. When the other tenne giants ſaw that their brother was ſo dead of one ſtroke, they had great ſorrow, and their bloud was much moued. Nature willed them to take vengeance. They did that in them was, and aſſailed Hercules eagerly on all ſides. And thus beganne the battell betwéene Hercules and the giants. Hercules dreaded not any ſtroke of ſword, of ſpeare, ne pollax: his ſkinne of the lion was harde and ſtrong: his ſtrength was ſtable, and his clubbe bare all, and ſo it was néed: great were the ſtrokes that they gaue eche other. The giants did all their endeuour, and gaue ſtrokes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to Hercules, but they coulde neuer pearce the ſkin of the lion, it was ſo hard: but yet was his clubbe more harder. The giants marueiled of the conſtance and puiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:7118:190"/>
of Hercules. Aſſoone as Hercules had lift vp his club for to ſmite on them, his enemies that were there, leaped aſide, and other while brake his ſtrokes: howbeit he did ſo much, that in leſſe time then an houre, hee ſlewe foure of them, and the other ſeuen fought afterwarde by ſuch vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, that the more he ſmote them with his clubbe, the more furious he found them and fierce, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The battell was terrible and hard, for the giants were ſtrong, &amp; long had vſed the ſkill of armes, and great paine had they to ſaue themſelues, and to auenge the bloud of their brethren, and for to haue worſhippe of the battell. And they ſayde, that they were infortunate, ſéeing they might not ouercome one man alone, nor match him. In fighting, they helped and comforted ech other, and had all good courage. But what profited them the great number of brethren? and what auailed them their couragious ſtrokes, when they were approching their death? Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules was alway Hercules: he reioiced much in the plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of his enemies, hee comforted himſelfe in fortune: fortune helped him, hee did marueiles on all ſides, well could he fight, and well defended he himſelfe, all that hee did was well done: all that other did, and indeuoured to do, was nought worth: notwithſtanding that they were mighty and hardy. But the lucke and good hap of Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les was not to bee broken, ne his clubbe coulde not bee foyled: but hee triumphed, and more was his puiſſance to ſuſteine the furies of his aduerſaries, then their might was to charge him with their ſtrokes. O marueilous ſtrength and might of a man. His puiſſance was not of a man, but of an elephant: his ſkin of the lion, ſéemed that it had bene tempered with quicke and hard ſtéele: his body ſéemed more conſtant againſt the cutting ſwordes of all his ill willers, then is an anuill againſt the ſtrokes of many hammers or great ſledges. There was no ſtroke of his enemie that grieued him: he tooke great pleaſure in the battell, ſéeing himſelfe among ſo many giants. He ſtil
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:7118:191"/>
greatly reioyced, and there was nothing grieuing him, but the declining of the day, which began to faile. At this houre, when the Sun withheld her rayes, and turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Weſt, Hercules would make an end, and ſpéede his battell. The giants began to ceaſe for to ſmite, for from the morning vnto the euening, they had fought without any ceaſing: and Hercules behaued himſelfe in ſuch wiſe, ſmiting vppon one and other, being about him, harde and ſharpely, that it befell ſo, that of ſome hée ouerthrew and brake helmets and heads, and of other, he brake armes and ſides maruellouſly, and gaue ſo many great ſtrokes, that finally; he beat downe, and to bruiſed them all, except Neſtor, which fled away when he ſaw the diſcomfiture. And therein did he wiſely, for all his brethren were there ſlaine by the hand of Hercules, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>When they of Cremona ſawe their Lordes dead, they had ſoone made an end of their weeping and ſorrowe, for they had béene to them hard and troubleſome. At the end of this battell, they aſſembled to councell, when they ſawe that Hercules had woonne the battaile, and concluded to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that they would yéeld themſelues to Hercules, and put themſelues to his mercy. With this concluſion they iſſued out of the gates in a great number, and came vnto Hercules, which was the conquerour of his enemies: firſt they knéeled before him downe to the ground: ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they prayed and required of him mercy: and thirdly, they ſurrendered vnto him their city and their goods, and ſayd to him, they woulde holde him for their lord during their liues. Hercules, that was pitifull and gentle vnto them that were méeke, and humbled themſelues, receiued the Cremonians into his grace, and made them to riſe &amp; ſtand vp, and after ſent for them of his hoſte. When they were come, he brought them into Cremona, where great ioy was made vnto them, for they were glad of the death of the giants. And there was no man, nor woman, nor childe, that thanked not the gods.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="371" facs="tcp:7118:191"/>By this maner was Hercules king of Cremona and inriched with a new title of victory. The firſt night that he entred into the city, he reſted him and his people: and then were they well refreſhed and right well feaſted and ſerued with vitaile. On the morrow he did cauſe to bring into the citie the bodies of the giants that were dead, and did bury them worſhipfully. And after he founded vpon them a very great tower and high, and vpon the tower he ſet xi. images or ſtatues of metall, after the faſhion of the giants that he had ſlaine, in remembrance of his victorie.</p>
                     <p>After the edification of this tower, Hercules left in Cremona, folke for to gouerne them, and departed thence for to goe further forth into the countrey. He ſtudied al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and was neuer idle: he ſtudied ſo much, that he could make the fire artificiall, aſwell as Cacus: and founde the remedies againſt the ſame. What by armes and by his ſcience, he gate a very great glory and praiſing in Italie. He went into many places, and ouer all where he came or went, men did him honour and reuerence. What ſhall I make long proceſſe? with great good aduenture, he went ſo farre, that he came to a citie ſtanding nigh the mount Auentin, where reigned a king named Euander, which receiued him ſolemnly. It is to be noted, that when Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus fled from Monchayo (as is ſayd) vnto this mount, hée came into Italie all diſpleaſant to haue loſt his ſeignorie. Then hee gaue leaue to depart from him to all his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, and all deſpaired alone, he went to the mount A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentin in an euening, where he was conſtrained to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw himſelfe, for he doubted much Hercules. When he was come aboue on this hill, he found there a great caue, and there he went in without ſupper, and then he began to be diſcomforted greatly &amp; bitterly, &amp; ſaid: Alas, now am I exiled &amp; baniſhed out of all my ſeignories &amp; lordſhips. Now haue I no ſuccour nor comfort of perſon. I dare not name me king, where I was wont by my name to make kings to tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble, alas al is turned, &amp; become vpſide down. I
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:7118:192"/>
haue nothing to eat, nor wote not where to lodge, vnleſſe it be with the beaſts. O poore king: where ſo any man ſo vnhappy as I? I am ſo infortunate and vnhappie, that I dare not be ſéene nor knowen. With theſe wordes he layd him downe vpon the bare ground, and layed a ſtone vnder his head, and with great paine and griefe fell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſléepe: which dured not long, for his veines were ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtirred, his heart was not quiet, and his body was right euilly ſuſteined. Anon he awoke, &amp; went out of the caue, for to looke if it were nigh day: for the night troubled him, and was to him too long. But when he was come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ayre, he ſaw no day appeare, nor ſtarres, nor moone ſhine, but he found it all darke, cloudy and thicke, and ſaw all the region of the aire couered with clouds, whereat he was greatly vexed and grieued. Then he went into the caue againe, not into the déepeſt, but at the mouth thereof, and there ſorrowful and penſiue abode without any more ſléeping till it was day.</p>
                     <p>When the day appeared, Cacus iſſued out of the caue, and went vp vnto the top of the hill, and beganne to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde and ſée the countrey about. The countrey ſéemed to him good and faire for to liue there. After great penſiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and many thoughts, he concluded in himſelfe, that he would abide there vnto the time that his fortune ceaſed, and would liue there of booties, rapin and theft. After he bethought himſelfe, that he would goe to king Pricus of Calidonie, which was his couſin, for to haue company to leade his wife with, that he had choſen, and that he would aſke and demand in mariage one of his daughters. With this concluſion he departed from the mount Auentin, and tooke the way vnto Calidony, going apace til he came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Some ſay that Calidony is the countrey that we call Calabrie. When Cacus was come to Calidonie, king Prycus receiued him, as it apperteined to a king, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as he knew him, and was of his linage: and after demanded him of his tidings. Cacus began to ſigh, when
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:7118:192"/>
he ſaw that he muſt tell his miſhappe, and then told him and recounted from the beginning to the end, howe Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules had taken from him his realmes, and how he hadde been beſieged, and how hee was eſcaped. And foraſmuch (ſaid he) as I dare not abide in mine owne countrey, I am come hither vnto you for refuge, and to tell and count my ſorrowes. And I haue intention to holde mee on the mount Auentin in a Caue that is there vntill that time mine enemie Hercules ſhall depart from mine heritage: and I will keepe mee there ſo ſecret that no man in the world ſhall haue knowledge thereof, to the end that Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules know it not, foraſmuch as he hath me in great hate, and he hath more greater hap and fortune in armes then I haue. And if hee knew that I were in any place, I am certaine that hee woulde come thither for to deſtroy mee. This conſidered, I haue choſen this caue for to hide me, as I haue ſaid: but forſomuch as I haue more ſorrowe in feacute;eling, then my taſte requireth, it is ſo that the eyes of a man being in great trouble, reioyce in the viſage and fight of a woman, for a woman is a gladneſſe and comfort of a man. Wherefore I require you, and pray you that ye will giue mee to wife one of your daughters. And if it pleaſe you ſo to doe, certes ye ſhall doe to me great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and the moſt friendſhip that I may haue for this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent time. The king Pricus anſwered and ſaide: Cacus ye be come and deſcended of high gentleneſſe, and haue great lordſhip and ſeignory in Heſperie. If fortune were againſt you this day, your highneſſe ought not therefore the worſe to be eſteemed. At this day I haue foure daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, of whom the one is named Yole. Take whom it pleaſeth you, except Yole: for I will not yet marry her. And if yee haue any will to make any army againſt Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules, tell it me plainly, and I will ſuccour you as a true friend. Cacus was right well content with the aunſwere of the king, and thanked him, ſaying that he would make no army for this ſeaſon, but hee woulde paſſe his time in
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:7118:193"/>
the caue, like as he had purpoſed and concluded. Then the thrée daughters of king Pricus were ſent for, and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus chooſe one of them, which hee wedded, and after lay with her, and abode there two daies. At the end of two daies, he would depart, and tooke leaue of the king. The king would haue deliuered vnto him tenne knightes and tenne Squires, for to haue brought him on his way, but he refuſed them and would none. Then hee woulde haue deliuered to him certaine ladies and damſels, but of all them he took none, ſaue the two ſiſters of his wife: which would by force go with him. Thus then he departed from Calidonie, accompanied with thrée ſiſters. He was alway ſorrowfull and penſiue, and from that time forth, thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in impatience for his miſhappe, and caſting out of his royaltie, he beganne to runne out, and bathed his axe in the bloud of the men, women and children that he mette, and put them al to death, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Cacus beganne to exerciſe the déeds of furie and of ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie, as he was going vnto the mount Auentin. Anon as he was come, he entered into the caue, the beſt wife he could with his wiues, and the moſt ſecretly. And of this place he made a neſt of theft, and a pit of ſinnes. For the firſt night that he had lodged his wiues, he went into the village that ſtood there faſt by, &amp; beheld the faireſt houſe, where into he entered by a window that was open, and ſlew all them that were therein: and after tooke all the goodes, aſmuch as hee might beare vppon his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and bare them into the caue, wheras were his wiues.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XXV. ¶How <hi>Cacus</hi> ſtole away the oxen and kine belonging to <hi>Hercules:</hi> and how <hi>Hercules</hi> fought with him therefore, and ſlew him.</head>
                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the morning Cacus found a right great ſtone of marble, which hee tooke and bare it vnto his caue, and made therewith his dore. The moſt part of that time Cacus held him in his caue, and went neuer out but when he would doe harme or euill. When hee went into the field, as is ſaid, he ſlew al the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that he met. He robbed euery man, he defloured women, hee burnt houſes and townes, and ſhortly ſpoiled, and did ſo much harme in I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly, that they that paſſed in the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey, ſuppoſed it to be deſtroied by the Gods, and could not knowe whereof, nor from whence came theſe perſecutions that Cacus made vpon them. For to returne then to our talke of Hercules: he came vnto the citie of king Euander, in the time that Cacus bedewed Italy with bloud of men, and filled his caue with continuall ſtollen goodes. After the comming of Hercules and of his men of armes, his beefes, or oxen, were brought into the citie, becauſe the king Euander ſhoulde ſee them. The king tooke great pleaſure to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold and ſée them: for they were high and paſſing faire. After that the king had ſéene them, Hercules demanded of him, whither hee might ſend for to paſtour them, for that night? In trueth Sir, ſaide Euander, if yee will followe my councell, yée ſhall let them abide in this Citie, and not ſend them into the fieldes. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaid Hercules? Euander aunſwered and ſaide, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as when we ſend out our beaſtes, we knowe not where they become. They haue beene ſtollen, and driuen away, and wee cannot knowe who be the rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:7118:194"/>
our ſeruauntes béen murdred, the houſes be burnt, the people that ſhould labour in the field, be ſlaine, the women and maidens bee violated and put to ſhame: and wee cannot remedie it. For wee cannot haue knowledge of the authours or doers thereof. Wherefore, ſome men ſay, &amp; will auouch it, that they be the Gods that thus pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh vs, for our ſinnes. Wherefore I pray you let your beaſts abide in this citie, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end that they be not ſtollen. Sir, ſaid Hercules, ye recount and tel to me a great mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell: I beleeue well that thoſe things that ye ſay be very true. But this notwithſtanding, ſince that the Gods haue ſaued them vnto this day, they will keepe them yet if it pleaſe them. For if they will haue them, euen as well they will take them in the Citie, as in the fieldes. And if there be a robber or theefe in the countrey that will take them away, I ſuppoſe I ſhall finde him, and ſhall make Italy quite of him. With theſe wordes, Hercules ſent his beaſtes into the paſture, and there left them without any keepers. The day paſſed ouer, the night came. In this night Cacus iſſued out of his caue, and went into the countrey for to pill and rob if hee might finde any booty. Thus as he that is vnhappy ſeeketh euill, and in the end he is paid at once for his treſpaſſes, the vnhappy aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture brought him into the medow, where as paſtured the oxen and kine of Hercules: it was nigh the morning, he had with him his three wiues. Aſſoon as he ſaw the beaſts by the light of the moone that ſhone cleere, he knew them. Anon he was all abaſhed, and his bloud chaunged in his viſage, and not without cauſe: for ſoon after his ſorrows began to grow on him, and came to the quickneſſe of the heart, that he could not ſpeake. His wiues ſeeing that he ſpake no worde, and that hee beheld the beaſtes, as all a wondred, came to him, and demaunded of him what hee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>iled? Alas, aunſwered Cacus, ſince it is ſo that yee muſt needes know: I tell you for certaintie, that all the ſorrow of the worlde ariſeth in my ſtomacke, and enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneth
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:7118:194"/>
mine heart: for I heere ſee the oxen of the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph of mine ennemy Hercules, and in beholding them, I remember the loſſes that I haue had by him, and the honours and worſhips that hee hath made mee for to looſe, and alſo the realmes that he hath taken away from me, and the great miſery that I am now in. Hee muſt needes be hereby in ſome place. Curſed be his comming, for I wote not what to doe: but in ſigne of vengeance, I will ſlea his oxen and his kine.</p>
                     <p>When the three ſiſters had heard y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Cacus ſo ſorrowed, they councelled him that hee ſhoulde not ſlea the beaſtes, Saying that if he ſlewe them, Hercules ſhoulde léeſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, for he ſhoulde eate them. It were better ſaide his wife, that ye take and leade away as many as ye may, and bring them into our caue: for if ye doe ſo, Hercules ſhall haue loſſe and diſpleaſure, and ye ſhall haue pleaſure and profite. Cacus beleeued that his wife ſaid to him, yet hee looked in the medow al aboutes, if any man had bin there to keepe them, but hee found no man nor woman: And then he came to the beaſts, and tooke eight of the beſt that he could chuſe, foure oxen and foure kine, after hee bound them togither with a corde by the tailes, and put the corde about his necke, and drewe them ſo in that maner vnto his caue, albeit that the beaſtes reſiſted ſtrongly to go backward in that maner. Cacus brought in this maner reculing, and going backward, al thoſe beaſtes that hee ſtale, to the end that no man ſhould follow him by the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the feete of the beaſtes.</p>
                     <p>When he had put in his caue the beaſtes of Hercules, as ſaid is, he ſhut the doore ſo well, that a man ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer haue knowne nor perceiued that there had been anie doore. Then weening that he had been ſure, he laid him downe and ſlept. Anon after, the ſunne riſing, and that it was day, Hercules that deſired much to heare tidings of his beaſtes, aroſe vp, and did ſo vſe the matter that the king Euander brought him vnto the place, whereas his
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:7118:195"/>
oxen and kine were. When they were come into the medow, Hercules found that he lacked foure oxen and as many kine: Whereat hee was ſore troubled, and for to knowe if the Gods had taken them, or any théeues hadde ſtollen them, he commaunded that they ſhould ſéeke all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the medowe, and ſée if the traches or the printes of the féete of the beaſtes might be ſéene or found. At this commandement, one and other began to ſéek. Some there were that looked toward the mount Auentin, and founde the ſtepps and footing of the oxen, but they thought by that footing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the beaſts were deſcended from the mount, for to come into the medowe. When al they had ſought long, and ſaw that they found nothing, they made their report vnto Hercules, and ſaide to him, that they coulde not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue on no ſide where theſe oxen were iſſued out, and that on no ſide they coulde finde any ſignes nor tokens of beaſtes going out of the paſture. But right now ſaid one, I haue found the ſteppes and feete of certaine oxen, and kine, that he deſcended from the mountaine into the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow. When Hercules heard, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> from the mountaine were come oxe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into the medow, he called Euander, &amp; demanded him, what people dwelles on the mountaine. Euander ſaid to him, that thereon dwelled no man nor beaſt: and that the mountaine was not inhabited. Hercules woulde go to ſee the footing: and went thither, and hee thought well that thither might haue paſſed eight great beaſtes in that night, for the traces of the feete were great and new. Then hee woulde wete where they were become: but hee found wel that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> footing of the beaſts took their end there as they paſtured. He was then right ſore a maruelled, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as there were no ſtrange beaſtes, and beganne to muſe. When he had a little pauſed, he beheld the mount, and ſaid, it muſt needes bee that the Gods haue rauiſhed mine oxen, or els that there is a théefe in this mountaine, that is come and hath ſtollen them, and hath led them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way reculing backward. But foraſmuch as I haue leſſe
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:7118:195"/>
ſuſpition of the Gods, then of the theefe, I will neuer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from hence vntill the time that I haue ſearched this mountaine from one ſide to another, for my heart iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that the beaſtes be here, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>With this concluſion Hercules did cauſe to take di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers calues that were there, and made them to faſt till noone. During this while hee ſent for his harneis and armes by Phylotes, and armed and made him ready to fight. Anon after midday, as the calues beganne to crie and bleate for hunger, he cauſed them then to be brought about the mountaine. Thus as they paſſed by the place where the caue was, and cried, it happened that the kine that were in the caue heard them, and anſwered, crying ſo loud, that the ſound paſſed by the holes of the caue, and came to the eares of the calues, and alſo of Hercules, and of other. When Hercules heard the crie of his kine, hee abode there: his calues beganne to cry again, but his kine cried no more, for Cacus by the force of their cries was awaked, and as he that alway doubted for to bee diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, roſe vp, and cut the throates of the kine. The calues then naturally knowing their dammes, cried very loud, and bleated as they that deſired the milke for to liue by. Howbeit they coulde not ſo loud cry, that their dammes aunſwered them: heereof maruelled much Hercules. Then he approched the mount, and went vnto the place where him ſéemed that he hadde heard the kine, and was there full three houres ſeeking if hee could finde any hole or caue or way to paſſe by. But howbeit that hee paſſed many times by the entry of the caue, hee could neuer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it. Some ſaid, that the noiſe and bleating that they had heard of the kine, was come by illuſion. The other ſaid, that Hercules loſt his labour and trauell, and praied him to leaue to ſéeke any more, for they thought them not recouerable. In the end when Hercules had heard one &amp; other, and ſaw that hee might not come to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, in a great anger he tooke in both armes a great tree
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:7118:196"/>
that grewe there, and ſhooke it three times with ſo great force, that at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> third time he ouerthrew it root and all, in ſuch wiſe that the roote that came out of the earth made a very great large hole ſo déepe, that the bottome of the caue was ſéene plainly.</p>
                     <p>When Hercules ſawe the great hole that the roote of the tree had made, hee was right ioyfull and glad, and ſaid: truely it is here that the great théefe dwelleth. I muſt ſée if he be heere, and what marchantes inhabite in this place. In ſaying theſe wordes, Hercules bowed downe his head, and beheld on the one ſide of the caue, where hee ſaw Cacus. Aſſoone as he ſaw the theefe, he knew him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, whereof he was more ioyous than he was before, and called to him, Cacus I ſee thee, thou haſt before this time troubled the realmes of Heſperie with innumerable treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes and great ſins that thou didſt commit openly and manifeſtly. This was the cauſe of the deſtruction of thy ſeignory. Now thou troubleſt the Italians with tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies ſecret and vnknowne. I know thy life. Thou maieſt not denie it, nor gainſay it. It behooueth that thou die therefore, and that I make the Italians franke and free from thine horrible and odious thefts. O curſed man, if thy crownes, thy Diademes, thy Scepters, thy renowns, thy royall men, might not maintaine thee: Why then, and wherefore art thou wrapped here ſtill in ſinnes, and amendeſt not, for all thy puniſhment that thou haſt ſuffered, but yet ſtill in the ſteed and place that thou ſhouldeſt diſpoſe thee to that, that appertaineth to a king and a prince, thou haſt been a theefe. In ſteed to doe iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, thou haſt been a murderer, and a putter in of fire to burne villages and houſes. And where thou ſhouldeſt haue kept and ſaued wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, thou haſt defloured them and done them villany. O caitife king, without coniuring or pining of thee, Certes, I ſee well, that thou art hee that the Italians know not, and that thou haſt perſecuted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Thy malice hath been great and thy ſubtiltie, ſeeing that
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:7118:196"/>
this day thou wert neuer bewraied, and haſt done great miſchiefe. But thy cunning is not ſo great, nor haſt not thou ſo hid thée, but thou art right nigh peril, for thou ſhalt yeeld to me againe my Oxen. And to conclude, thou ſhalt put mee to death, or thou ſhalt die by my hand, and thou ſhalt not eſcape by running, nor by thy ſubtile ſhiftes.</p>
                     <p>When Cacus vnderſtood this ſentence, he was excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly afraid, neuertheleſſe he lifted vp his head, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he was found by Hercules, the onely man of the world that he moſt hated, he ſaid to him: Alas Hercules, a man all corrupted with couetouſneſſe: what curſed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune hath made thee to draw out the tree whereof the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found and déepe rootes hath couered the ſecret abode of king Cacus late reigning, but nowe depriued from reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and baniſhed from all worldly proſperitie? Suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it not to thee, that I may haue the vſe of my natural forces to liue by, when thou haſt taken al away from me, and that I am forced to liue of robbery and ſpoile, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the blame and fault ought to redound vpon thee: Why ſuffereſt thou not me to liue and drawe forth the reſidue of my poore life, among the ſtones, among the rockes, and among the wormes of the earth? Conſider nowe, what thou haſt done to this king, and ſeeke him no more. Thou haſt hurte and greeued him enough. Hercules anſwered Cacus. In the déepeſt of thy depthes of wretchedneſſe and miſeries, thy demerites wil accuſe thee: and I am right ſory and greeued to ſée a king in ſo wofull and ſhamefull eſtate: but ſeeing thou canſt not beautifie thy dayes paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed or preſent with one onely good deed, what remedie? thou haſt dayly exerciſed tyranny as well in proſperitie as in aduerſitie. I wote well that thou art the newe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuter of the Italians, and that thy hand is all foule with their bloud. I ſéeke thée not, nor the Italians can ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of thee. And for aſmuch as they complaine not of thee, hauing cauſe to their preiudice, this tree hath ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:7118:197"/>
for them, and by his rootes hee hath diſcouered thine ambuſh. So behoueth it that thou chooſe, whether thou wilt come and fight with me here in the aire at large, or els that I come and aſſaile thée there within. For if it be to me poſſible, I will deliuer the world from thy tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>By this anſwere, Cacus knew that there was no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite for his life. Then he intended to ſaue him as he had done aforetime, and made by his crafte ſo great a ſmoke and fume, that it ſéemed to come out of the hole that the tree had made, as it had ben a very pitte of hell. And this fume was mingled with flames burning as it was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile. For all this fume Hercules left not Cacus, but leapt into the Caue, in the middle of the flames and fume, as he that was maiſter of the craft, and was quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purueied of remedies that thereto appertained, and went in luſtily and aſſailed Cacus, in ſuch wiſe as he felt no fume nor let: and then hee gaue him ſo great a ſtroke vpon the helme with his clubbe, that he made him to hit his head againſt the walles of the caue. Cacus with the receiuing of this ſtroke, let the fume diſgorge out of his ſtomacke, ſeeing that by that maner he could not eſcape, and tooke his huge great axe, that ſtood by him, for to defend him with. Hercules ſuffered him to take his axe. Cacus ſmote vpon him, for the caue was not large: &amp; they fought long therein. Vnto the reſkewe of Cacus came the thrée ſiſters, that made great ſorrowe, and did caſt ſtones vppon Hercules in great aboundaunce, and wept bitterly.</p>
                     <p>Theſe three damſels loued very wel Cacus. Hercules and Cacus fought more then a long houre without cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. At the end of the houre, they were both ſo ſore cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed, that they muſt needes reſt them. Then Cacus tooke in himſelfe a great pride, for he was ſtrong of body, and him ſéemed, when he had reſted, that Hercules was not ſo ſtrong as hee had been afore times, &amp; that he might
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:7118:197"/>
neuer vanquiſh him, foraſmuch as he had not ouercome at the beginning. By this preſumption hee demaunded of Hercules, if he would finiſh the battell without the caue. Hercules anſwered, that he was content. With this aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere Cacus tooke away the ſtone that ſhut the caue, and went out, and in going after him, Hercules eſpied his kine that were dead in a corner, and his oxen that were bounden by the muſſels vnto a piller: He was ſory when he ſawe his kine in that caſe. Neuertheleſſe hee paſſed forth, and purſued Cacus, that reached out his armes, and made him ready, and ſaide to him: Thou curſed theefe, thou haſt done to me great diſpleaſure to haue ſlaine my kine. Yea (curſed theefe thou thy ſelfe) anſwered Cacus, yet haſt thou done to mee more diſpleaſure, to haue ſlaine my men and taken away my realmes. Thou art onely culpable of the euill that I haue done, and of the death of thy kine. I would it pleaſed the Gods, that I had thee as well in my mercy, as I had them: be thou ſure that thou ſhouldeſt neuer take away realm from no man: and now let vs diſpatch our battaile. At theſe wordes, Hercules and Cacus ſmote each other right ſore, and with great fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſo as their ſtrokes cleaued to their harneis, &amp; made a great noyſe. At this noiſe, the king Euander and the Gréekes came to the battaile, for to ſée it, which they made before the entry of the caue, whereas were the thrée ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters paſſing deſolate. Cacus enforced him with all his puiſſance: For he ſaw it was time, then or neuer to ſhew and put forth all the force that he might. Hee handled his axe right mightily, and well was him need ſo to doe. Hee was hard and boyſterous: he gaue many a ſtroke to Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules. And him ſeemed otherwhile that hee ſhoulde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found him vnto the déepe pit of the earth. But Hercules on his ſide failed not, though he had a ſtrong party againſt him: He was alſo ſtrong at the combate, and more ſtrong then was good for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> health of Cacus. He ſmote neuer Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus, but he turned his eies in his head, or made him ſtoup,
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:7118:198"/>
or knéele on the one ſide or the other, or to go back ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. This battaile by long during gréeued the beholders, they ſo aſſailed eche other, and fought hard on both ſides. Finally, they did ſo much that they were driuen to reſt them, and that all their bodies ſwette all aboutes. When Hercules ſawe, that yet was not the victory wonne, and that the night approched, he had great ſhame in himſelfe, that he had held ſo long battaile. Then he began to lay on Cacus ſo hard, and redoubled his ſtrokes with ſuch force vpon Cacus ſo fiercely, that at laſt hee bare him downe to the ground all aſtonied, and made him to looſe his axe, and then tooke off his helme. The three ſiſters fledde then into a forreſt named Oeta, all ful of teares and cries. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Gréekes would haue gone after: but Hercules made them to returne. After hee called the king Euander and his folke, and ſaid to the king. Sir, lo here is he that was wont to trouble the Italians with ſecret murders, couert theftes, and vnknowne defiling of women. Giue no more ſuſpition to the Gods. Lo here is the miniſter and doer of theſe treſpaſſes, I haue intention to puniſh him, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after his deſert, but vnto the death.</p>
                     <p>Euander anſwered to Hercules and ſaid: Prince excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and worthy aboue all worthies, and the moſt beſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed of all men flouriſhing in armes: What reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is to thée due? thou deſerueſt not only humane reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, but that reuerence that is of diuine nature: I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue aſſuredly that thou art a God, or the ſon of a God, or els a man deiſied. Thou in eſpeciall haſt ſeene more in a moment, then all the eyes in generall of all the Italians haue ſeene, not in a whole yeare, but in an hundred yeres. O the bright reſplendant ſunne of noble men, and faire ſhining with glorious feates and deedes: how may wee thanke thee, and giue thée land for thy deſert in this great worke? Thou (by thy moſt excellent labour) haſt diſburdened vs from darkneſſe, and haſt giuen vs light of cleereneſſe: thou haſt effected more then the great troups
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:7118:198"/>
and all the aſſemblies &amp; men of armes of Italians would haue béene able to do. Thou haſt gotten more triumph in chaſtiſing of this giant paſſing terrible, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we be able to reward thee for. Truly if thou be not a god, thou haſt from the gods their ſingular grace. I promiſe to thée, in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of this labour, to build a ſolemne temple in my ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, where thou ſhalt haue an altar, and vpon the altar ſhall be thy repreſentation of fine golde, and the repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of this tyraunt, in ſhewing how thou haſt vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed him, to the end that our heires and ſucceſſors in time comming, may haue thereof knowlege.</p>
                     <p>During theſe wordes, Cacus refreſhed him, who was aſtonied of the ſtroke that he had receiued, and thought to haue fled: but Hercules ranne after, and caught holde of him, and embraced him in his armes, ſo hard that he could not ſtirre from him, and brought him againe, &amp; bare him vnto a deepe pit that was in the caue, where he had caſt in all ordures and filth. Hercules came vnto this foule pit that the Gréekes had founde, and put Cacus therein, his head downward from on high vnto the ordure beneath. Then the Italians came about the pit, and caſt ſo manie ſtones vpon him, that he died there miſerably. Such was the end of the poore king Cacus: he died in an hole full of ordure &amp; of ſtincking filth. When the king Euander ſaw that hee was dead: by the conſent of Hercules, hee made him to be drawen out of the pit, and cauſed him to be born into his citie, whereas Hercules was receiued ſo trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantly, that no man can rehearſe. The feaſt was great that night in the palace of king Euander, and paſſed with great ioy. On the morrow the king Euander cauſed to be ſet forth the body in the common view and ſight of all the people, and afterward ordeined certeine folke thereto <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="386" facs="tcp:7118:199"/>
they that had the gouernance thereof, bare it into diuers places, and alway they praiſed Hercules. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the nouelty of this victory, the king Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der made to beginne the Temple that he had promiſed to Hercules, &amp; required Hercules, that he would abide there in that countrey vntill the time that his Temple ſhoulde be fully made and finiſhed. Hercules beheld how the king Euander did labour about building his temple, with all diligence, and agreed to his requeſt, foraſmuch as him ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that the Temple would be ſhortly made. And ſome books ſay, that long time before, the god Mars had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to Hercules, that there ſhould be a temple made vnto him: and for that cauſe he was come into Italy, for to wit if his deſtiny ſhould happen or no. And when the Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians heard recount the birth of Hercules, they beléeued better, that he was the ſonne of god Iupiter, then of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phitrion.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He glorious déeds of Hercules were greatly recommended in Italy, aſwel for that he had vanquiſhed the giants of Cremona, as for the death of Cacus. So great was his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noume, that during the building of his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, all maner people came thither, for to ſee him, and did to him diuine honours, naming him the ſonne of god Iupiter. The kings and the lords came to him, for to giue him gifts and rich preſents. Among all other, the quéene of Laurentia came thither from her citie, with manie chaires and chariots, filled and laden with iewels, and preſented them to Hercules. Hercules receiued into his grace this quéene &amp; her preſents, and thanked her great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:7118:199"/>
This quéene had to name Facua, and was wife of the king Fanus, ſonne of the king Pricus, the ſonne of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne: ſhe was yong, freſh, tender, and full of luſtineſſe. She had not ſéene king Fanus her huſband in foure yere, for he was gone into a farre countrey, and was not in all this time come againe. So it happened that after ſhe firſt began to take héed of and beholde Hercules, and to marke him well, ſhe began to deſire his company and acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: and ſhe loued him ſo ſore and excéedingly, that ſhée could not turne her eyes nor her thoughts vppon none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing but vpon Hercules. In the beholding &amp; ſéeing him, ſhe ſayd in her heart, that he was the moſt well fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uored man, and proper without compariſon, that euer ſhe ſaw, and that of right men ſhould giue him laud &amp; praiſe, ſaying moreouer, that her ſéemed that her heart was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled with the fire of his loue: many cogitations and thoughts ran in her minde. Nowe was ſhe awaked and quickned with a ioyous ſpirit, &amp; eftſoone all penſiue. She paſſed ſo the firſt day that ſhe came in this maner w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules. When ſhe was gone away for to reſt, ſhe layd her downe on a bed all clothed, and there ſhe began to thinke on the beautie of Hercules with ſo ardent deſire, that ſhe could not abſteine from wéeping, &amp; ſore wiſhed after him: whereof the end was ſuch, that after many imaginations, about the gray morning, ſhe began to ſay vnto her ſelfe: O fortune, what man, what priuie, what king haſt thou brought into this countrey? This is not a king like o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. This is an image ſingular, and like as if the gods had made him by nature to exceede and triumph aboue all her other ſubtill workes and labours. All glory ſhineth in him not onely by his valiant proweſſe, but by his ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and ſacred perfection of bodie, to which may be made no compariſon. O cleere image among the nobles, who is ſhe ſéeing his eyes, that with one onely ſight will not haue her heart thorowly pearſed? who is ſhe that will not couet and deſire his grace? The moſt fortunate of al
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:7118:200"/>
happie, and well fortuned ſhall ſhe be that may get his good will: he is humble, faire, pleaſant, and laughing: he is a treaſure. O deare treaſure: like as the golde paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth all other maner mettals, in like ſort he paſſeth all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther works of nature in all proſperities: how then ſhal I not loue him? As long as I ſhall liue, his name ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine written in my memory, and his beauty ſhall not be forgotten, but remaine for a memoriall eternall,</p>
                     <p>Great were then the praiſes that Facua vttered of Hercules: ſhe forgate anon the king Fanus, and put him all in neglect for the loue of Hercules. She was there a certaine ſpace of time, and alway thought on Hercules. Hercules that thought nothing of her, made vnto her no ſemblance nor ſigne of loue: howbeit he talked oft times with her, and with the wife of the king Euander, named Carmenta. The more he conferred with them, the more was Facua in great paine by the inflaming of loue: ſome time ſhe loſt her colour and countenance, but certainly ſhe couered it, and hid it ſo well, that no man tooke héede of it. Then when ſhe had bene there eight dayes, bearing ſuch grieuous paine, ſhe ſaw that Hercules could not perceiue the loue that ſhee had to him: for to come to the end of her deſire, ſhe came on a day to Hercules, and humbly requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him that he would come and take the paines to come to her houſe, for to paſſe the time, whiles the king Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der there finiſhed his temple. Hercules accorded, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed vnto her requeſt, whereat ſhe had very great ioy in her ſelfe. They then diſpoſed themſelues for to goe vnto Laurencia, and tooke leaue of the king Euander, and of the queene, and ſo tooke their way. Thus then going, Hercules was alway by the ſide of Facua, who reaſoned of many things by the way: and alway Facua had her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous eyes fixed on the view of Hercules, that at laſt Hercules began to take heed, and ſayd to her ſoftly thus: Lady, you doe me great worſhippe to bring me into your houſe. Alas ſir, anſwered Facua, I do to you nothing but
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:7118:200"/>
trouble you: for I haue not the power to feaſt you and make you chéere as I fain would. Lady (ſaid Hercules) the good chéere that ye beſtow on me, is to me acceptable, ſo that from henceforth ye bind mine heart for to bée wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to fulfill your will in ſuch wiſe that there is nothing that ye deſire, but I will accompliſh it at your comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, after my power, as to anie the moſt beſt accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed lady that is in the Weſt part. Facua with theſe wordes began to ſmile, and anſwered. Sir, I haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing done for you: and ye are not ſo beholding to me as ye ſay. Howbeit I thanke you for your good worde. And thereof I hold me right fortunate and happy, for that the moſt worthy man of all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>en dayneth to accompany one ſo poore a lady as I am. Lady (anſwered Hercules) I take not that to be attributed rightly to me, to ſay, that I am the moſt worthy of men: for there haue béen ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny better then I am. But certes the more ye ſpeake, the more ye make me your ſubiect. And ſince you doe to mee ſo great honour, I requeſt you as much as I may, that I may be your knight, and that ye take power ouer mée to commaund me to doe your wil and pleaſure. Sir, ſaid Facua, will ye that it be ſo? Lady (anſwered Hercules) alas yea. I will not commaund you, ſaid Facua, but I will giue you ouer me aſmuch ſeignorie and lordſhip as it ſhall pleaſe you to take. Hercules with the ſame word, would faine haue kiſſed the lady, and had done it, had it not béen for the worſhip of her, which hee woulde keepe. They had enough of other conferences. From that day forth Hercules intended to pleaſe the lady more then hée had done before. And ſhortly hee acquainted himſelfe ſo with her, and ſhe with him, that they lay togither ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And he begat on her a ſonne that was named Latine, which was afterward of great gouernment.</p>
                     <p>During theſe things, whiles that Hercules and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cua had this good time in Laurencia, tidinges came that the king Fanus was comming. Facua, that then began
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:7118:201"/>
firſt to ioy in the loue of Hercules, was paſſing ſorie and heauy, when ſhe heard theſe tidings, for ſhee firmly fixed her heart on Hercules. Sodainly the teares all blubbered her eies. And ſo wéeping ſhe came into a chamber where as Hercules was: then ſhée tooke him apart, and ſaid to him. Alas my loue, I ſhall die for ſorrow. Lady, ſaid Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules, wherefore? Forſomuch ſaid ſhe, as my huſband the king Fanus commeth home: It is full foure yeare ſince I heard of him, I had ſuppoſed he had been dead, but hee is not. His herbingours and fourriers bee come before, and ſay, that he will ſuppe héere this day. Alas, what euil aduenture is this? we muſt néedes now depart, and our communication ſhall faile. With this word the lady em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced Hercules, and fell downe in a ſowne in his lappe. Hercules tooke her vp, and comforted her the beſt wiſe he could, and ſaid to her, that ſince it is ſo that ſhee was married, it was reaſon that ſhee abode ſtill with her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. Whatſoeuer Hercules ſaid vnto the Ladie, ſhee coulde not kéepe her from weeping, nor bewailing her loue, and her bewailinges were great. In the end ſhee went into her chamber, and dried her eyes, and brake off her dolorous weeping aſmuch as ſhe could, arraying and apparrelling her in ſuch wiſe, as if ſhee had been ioyous and glad of the comming of her huſband, who came ſoone after, and entred into his citie with great triumph.</p>
                     <p>Hercules and Facua went againſt the king Fanus. When the king Fanus ſaw Hercules, hee did to him as much honour and worſhip as he could doe: Foraſmuch as he had heard ſay, and was aduertiſed of the deeds of arms that he had done againſt the giants of Cremona, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Cacus: and thanked him, forſomuch as hee was come into his citie. For concluſion, Hercules abode there foure daies after that Fanus was come home: on the fifth day hée conſidered, that hee might no more enioy his loue, and that he did nothing there but looſe his time: ſo he tooke leaue of the king Fanus, and of the queene
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:7118:201"/>
Facua, and returned vnto the houſe of the king Euander, where he held him, and abode vnto the time that his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was made and accompliſhed. About the conſummati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this temple, an Herauld of Calidonie, came to Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules, and ſignified to him, that the king Pricus came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him with a great puiſſance of men of armes, for to reuenge the bloud of Cacus his couſen: and that he char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Hercules, that he hadde without a cauſe (and cruelly put to death one ſo noble a king as Cacus was: and ſaid to him moreouer that if he would mainteine the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, on the morrow early he ſhould finde the king Pricus in the ſame place where the bloud of king Cacus was ſhed: and that there, by mortall battell, by puiſſance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt puiſſance, he would prooue it true that he ſaid.</p>
                     <p>When Hercules had wel heard, what the king Pricus had ſignified to him: he had his heart all full of ioy, and anſwered to the Herauld, that the death that he had made Cacus to die, was a worke of iuſtice, and that vppon the quarrell, hee woulde furniſh by battell the king Pricus, at the houre and place that hee had ſaid. After this aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere thus made, Hercules gaue vnto the Herauld has gowne that he ware, and did him to be feaſted right wel, ſaying, that he had brought him tidinges of pleaſaunce. When the herauld had had good chéere, and wel feaſted, as Hercules had commanded: He returned vnto the king Pricus, &amp; tolde him, what Hercules had anſwered to him, and that he ſhould haue on the morrow the battaile. The king Pricus, that ſuppoſed to haue wonne all by aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of multitude, (for he had in his hoſte mo then thirty thouſand men) thanked the Gods of theſe tidinges: and came and lodged him the ſame night, nigh vnto the mount Auentin, vpon the riuer of Tyber. He made him readie then for to fight this battaile. And likewiſe Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules: eche man on his ſide thought on his workes. The night paſſed ouer, and on the morrow as ſoone as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to dawn, the king Pricus &amp; Hercules began to ſound
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:7118:202"/>
their great tabours, and with that ſound, their men put them in armes to be ready, and after trained in battaile order. And ſo they came both parties, as well the one as the other, into the ſame place where the bloud of king Cacus had béen ſhed, &amp;c.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Bout fiue of the clocke in the morning, Hercules and Pricus aſſembled at the battaile: from as farre as Pricus ſawe Hercules, hee made a maruellous cry. With this cry, all the Calidoniens be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to runne againſt Hercules<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and made ſo great a noiſe that it ſéemed that there was not people enough in all the world for them. But certainly like as a ſmall raine aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth or laieth downe a great winde, in likewiſe Hercules alone laid downe their ouer great boaſting and vproare. For aſſoone as he ſawe his enemies runne againſt him, about a quarter of a mile off, hee departed from his bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile that was well ſet in order, and after that he hadde commaunded his folke that they ſhoulde not haſte for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, hee beganne to runne againſt the Calidoniens ſwiftly, not like an horſe, but like an Hart that no man might ouertake. The king Euander was all abaſhed for to ſée in Hercules ſo great nimbleneſſe and ſwiftneſſe. Pricus and the Calidoniens, when they ſawe him mooue from the hoſte, they ſuppoſed that it had béen a horſe or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beaſt. In the end when Hercules was come nigh to them, within the ſpace of a bow ſhot, they knewe that it was Hercules, whereat they were ſore abaſhed of his comming. Pricus cried to haue ſet his men vppon him.
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:7118:202"/>
They ſhot arrowes, and caſted dartes and ſpeares vpon Hercules, againſt all the partes of his body: neuertheles they coulde neuer pierce nor enter into the ſkinne of the Lion, and he neuer reſted till hee hadde accompliſhed his courſe, thruſting him among his enemies ſo mightily, that ouerthrowing all before him, like as it hadde béen a tempeſt or thunder, hee went into the midſt of the hoſte, whereas there was the chiefe banner of the king Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus.</p>
                     <p>Hercules abode and ſtaied there, but beganne to ſmite and lay on vpon the one ſide and the other, and to die his ſword with the bloud of the Calidoniens. His ſworde was ſo heauy that no man might endure it, it al to bruſed all that it raught. It made the place red, whereas the bloud of Cacus was ſhedde, with bloud vppon bloud, and with dead men vpon dead. Then was not the ſhame and death of king Cacus auenged, but augmented vppon the perſons of his friendes, in abundance of ſlaughter and of murther. The crie aroſe greatly about Hercules: he brake and all to rent the banners, and the recogniſances of the Calydoniens, and of their conductors: there was none ſo hardy, but he draue him away: and there was none ſo reſolute, but he was afraid and trembled. All the beſt and hardieſt fled before him. Then hee made what ſpoile hee would with his enemies. Theſeus, Euander, and other came then vnto the battaile. At this conflict there was many a ſpeare broken, many a halberd and many a helm broken, and many a knight ſmitten in peeces. The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidoniens were in great number, and there were many of them ſtrong and mightie. The battaile was right ſtrong and mighty and fierce. The king Pricus ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt before vppon the Gréekes, and laboured with his hand right cheualrouſly. And Hercules and Theſeus did worthily and deſeruing memory: they ranne from ranck to rancke, and brake the ranckes of their enemies. They comforted and encouraged their men, and ſhewed to them
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:7118:203"/>
how they ſhoulde doe. Their feates and deedes were ſo great, that it is impoſſible to recount and tell: for in little time they put their enemies in deſpaire. What ſhall I ſay? all the diſcomfiture was in the Calidoniens, for by force of armes they abode vppon the fielde for the moſt part. And then when the king Pricus ſaw, that his people could no more fight, and that he loſt on all ſides, &amp; that fortune was againſt him in all points, after hee had ſore labored, &amp; that he had néed of reſt, hee withdrew him out of the preaſe, &amp; ſounded a retrait, and with the ſound, the Calidoniens turned back, and fled after king Pricus.</p>
                     <p>When Hercules ſaw that the Calidoniens withdrew the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, he made in like wiſe his Gréeks to withdraw them: not for any need they had, but for to ſhewe their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, that they woulde well that they ſhoulde reſt them. In this wiſe the battell ceaſed, Hercules ſuppoſing that the Calidoniens would aſſemble on the morrowe when they had reſted them: but they withdrewe themſelues, ſome heere and ſome there. The day paſſed, the night came on: then the king Pricus aſſembled his folke, and ſhewed to them their loſſe, and the ſtrength and might of the Greekes, and in eſpeciall of Hercules. After hee ſaid to them, that they could neuer conquer them, and that they could no wiſelier doe then to withdrawe them, and to returne into their countrey. The Calidoniens that dreaded Hercules more then the death, or tempeſt, or thunder of the heauen: had great ioy, when they vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the will of king Pricus: and anſwered all with one accord, that they were ready to go forth on the way. With this anſwer they concluded, that they ſhould leaue their tentes, their cartes and armours, for to go lightly and more ſecretly. After this they tooke their way, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their concluſion, &amp; faire and ſoftly they went their way without making ſtir or noiſe, and did trauel ſo much this night y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> on the morrow they were far from Hercules. After this, on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> morrow when Hercules eſpied that they
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:7118:203"/>
were fled, he and his men purſued after ſwiftly, howbeit they could not ouertake them. For, to ſpéede the matter, the king Pricus returned into Calidonie. Hercules pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued him into his citie, which was ſtrong with walles, and beſieged him. During this ſiege, there was neuer a Calidonien that durſt come out. Hercules oft times aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted the citie, but he loſt his labour. At length, when he ſaw that he could not get ne win vpon his enemies, he called his Gréeks, and ſayd to them: that man that ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tureth not winneth nothing. We ſoiourne here without doing any thing worthy of memory. Our enemies will not come againſt vs, vnleſſe we fetch them, and thus we ſhal haue no end: ſhortly we muſt all win or looſe. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I thinke it beſt that I diſguiſe me, and goe vnto the gate, &amp; let the porters vnderſtand that I haue an errand vnto the king: and heereupon, if I may enter, I will goe vnto the king, &amp; ſo deale, if it be poſſible, that he ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer aſſault me any more in battell. And if it happen that I may ſo doe, as I haue tolde you, I will that ye aſſaile the citie aſſoone as I ſhall be within, to the end that the Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians may haue to do with you aſwell as with me, and that I haue them not all at once vpon me.</p>
                     <p>When Theſeus and Euander vnderſtoode well what Hercules would do, they anſwered, that they were ready to obey all his commandements, and that they would aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault the citie, after his ſaying. Then Hercules arrayed himſelfe like as he had béene an embaſſadour, and Theſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us &amp; the Gréeks diſpoſed themſelues to make the aſſault. When al was ready, Hercules departed and came &amp; knoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked at the gate of Calidonie: the porters looked out at a little window, to ſee who knocked there, and ſéeing that there was but one man in a long gowne, they opened to him the gate, and aſked him what he would haue? Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les anſwered, that he ſought the king. And what would ye with him, ſaid one of the porters? Hercules ſayd, I would faine ſpeake vnto his perſon: and ſaying theſe wordes,
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:7118:204"/>
the porters ſawe that Hercules was armed vnder the gowne: and then at few wordes they cried, vppon him, and laid at him before and behinde, ſaying that he was a traitor, and that hee was come to eſpie the citie. When Hercules ſaw him to ſet vpon by the porters, he was there as he would be, and had great ioy: which hee couered vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſimple countenance, and made at the beginning ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance that he would haue fled away and eſcaped: but hée emploied ſo little of his ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth, that the porters brought him vnto the king Pricus, which ſate in the hall with his daughters and his princes, &amp; preſented him to him, ſaying: Sir, lo heere is a traitour, that is entered into your citie for to eſpie your power. We haue taken him: he ſaid that he would ſpeake vnto your perſon, and hée is armed vnder his mantel as ye may ſée: it is a right euil token: for a man deſiring to ſpeake to a king, ſhould in no wiſe be armed priuily nor couertly.</p>
                     <p>When the king vnderſtood the accuſation of the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, whiles they ſpake, hee beheld Hercules, and knew him: Whereat hee was ſo ſore afraid, that hee wiſt not what to ſay. Hercules then beſtirred himſelfe and wrung himſelfe out of the holding of the porters, caſting them downe to the ground ſo hard and ſo greeuouſly, that they neuer after might reléeue themſelues. When the Caly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doniens that were in the hall, ſaw him ſo euill intreate the porters, they threatned Hercules vnto the death, and aſſailed him on all ſides. His gowne was then anon rent off. In bickering he receiued many a ſtroke, and alway he defended himſelfe without diſplaying of his power and of his ſtrength, as he that awaited for the tidings of the aſſault that was nigh. The affray was great in the hall and in the citie on al partes, the Calidoniens ranne to the pallace, for to aſſaile Hercules. King Pricus made him ready, &amp; came with other vnto this fray. Then was Hercules aſſailed fiercely: but this aſſault was déere to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king: for to his welcome Hercules came to the tabernacle
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:7118:204"/>
that ſtoode vppon foure great barres of yron, whereof hee tooke the one, and beat downe the tabernacle. After he lifted vp his arme with the bar, and ſmote the king Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus ſo vnmeaſurably vpon the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>At this time the crie aroſe great among the Calidoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. Not alonely there, but alſo in the citie (for hee that kept the watch ſounded to armes, foraſmuch as the Greeks aſſailed haſtily the walles.) Calidony was then terribly troubled, and the Calidonians wiſt not where to turne them, whether to Hercules, or to the aſſault. All was full of heades armed, aſwell in the pallace as vppon the walles. After this that Hercules had ſlaine the king Pricus, he beganne to ſmite vppon his enemies, and his ſtrokes were great, at ech ſtroke he ſlew two or three, ſo as ſhortly he bare himſelfe there a knightly, that in little while hee couered all the pauement of the pallace with dead bodies of the Calidonians, lying one vpon another, without that any man might dammage his armor. The Calidonians were of great courage, and had great ſhame for that they might not ouercome Hercules, that alone had done vpon them ſo great an exploit. They aſſailed him with great courage, and caſt vpon him darts &amp; ſharpe iauelines. His armes and his ſhoulders bare all, and he did ſo great things with his barre, and gaue ſo great ſtrokes, that none of them might reſiſt his ſtrength. The poore Calidonians came thither with great courage and deſire for to reuenge the death of their king. Hercules put ſo many to death, that hee wiſt not where to ſet his foote, but it muſt be vpon Calidonians. Before the gate of the pallace was a pitifull noiſe of wéepings &amp; of cries, that women and children made. In the end, when the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidonians knew and perceiued the vertue &amp; the ſtrength
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:7118:205"/>
of Hercules, and that they laboured in vaine, they ceaſſed to aſſaile him, and fled. Then Hercules iſſued out of the pallace with his barre all couered with bloud. Aſſoone as the Calidonians ſaw him, they ſet vpon him paſſing fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly, and aſſailed him anew: they caſt ſtones and darts vpon him, they ſhotte arrowes on him aboundantly, as they that were purueyed, and awaited for his paſſage. In this aſſault Hercules had much to ſuffer: yet after recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing moe ſtrokes then canne be numbred, he paſſed the watch, that awaited to haue ſtaine him, and reſted neuer till he came vnto the gate.</p>
                     <p>The Calidonians ranne then after him, as men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out dread of death, and mightily ſwollen with pride and ire, beganne on anew to ſmite vppon his ſhoulders, and vpon his backe. When Hercules ſaw that, he turned his face vppon his euill willers, and ſmote vppon them with his barre, on the right ſide, and on the left ſide, ſo luſtily, that he died his barre with newe bloud: and maugre his enemies, he beat them downe, and all to bruiſed them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him. He made them then to recule and go backe more then fourtie paſes: and after came to the gate. And the Calidonians purſued him againe: but ere they came vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, he all to brake &amp; bruiſed, and to fruſhed the lockes, and the wickets, and doores of the gate: and the Greekes aſſailed him with all their power, and beate downe the draw bridge. After he called the aſſailants, and they came vnto him, and with little reſiſtance they entred the citie, which was at that time with great ſlaughter of the Calidonians that would not yéeld themſelues, nor put themſelues to mercy, vntill the time that they ſaw their ſtréets and houſes full of dead bodies. &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Y this maner was king Pricus ſlaine, and his city taken by Hercules. After the ſlaughter, when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Calidoniens had hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled themſelues, Hercules and Theſeus went to the pallace, &amp; they came thither ſo fitly, that they found the daughters of king Pricus, with their ladies and gentlewome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſéeking the king among the dead bodies. There were ſo manie dead bodies, that they could not finde nor know him that they ſought. Hercules at his comming beganne to behold one and other, and eſpecially among al other, hee caſt his eie vppon Yole, the daughter of the king: foraſmuch as ſhe was excellently gliſtering in beautie, that in all the world was none like vnto her. When hee had a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held her, by a ſecret commaundement of loue, hee drewe him vnto her, wéening for to haue comforted her. Anon, as the right deſolate gentlewoman ſaw Hercules appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching vnto her, ſhe trembled for dread, and fled vnto her chamber, the ladies and the gentlewomen followed her: and among them ſo did Hercules. What ſhall I ſay? hee entered into the chamber where ſhe was, and ſate downe by her. She thought to haue riſen for to haue gone out of the way, but he held her by her clothes and ſaid vnto her: Lady, ye may not flie my companie. Yole ſpake then and ſaid: O miſerable tyraunt, what ſéekeſt thou me nowe for to trouble mee more? Thou haſt ſlaine my father, let that ſuffice thee. Madame (anſwered Hercules) if the king Pricus be dead, it is reaſon that he be not much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailed nor wept: for he thinking for to auenge the death
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:7118:206"/>
of the tyraunt Cacus, came not long ſince for to aſſaile me in Italy, ſaying: that I had vnrightfully and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe ſlaine him. In maintaining the contrary, I fought with him vppon this quarrell: the battaile was not ended, nor put to vtterance at that time, for he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew himſelfe with his people, and came into this citie. and I haue purſued him haſtily, albeit I coulde not ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take him. When I ſaw that, I laide my ſiege about this citie: he would not come to fight the battaile during my ſiege, wherefore I haue this day willed to haue an end. Fortune hath béen on my ſide, and hath put you in my power. Certes, it muſt néedes be, that without remedie ye be my lady and my loue: for in ſéeing your ſingular beauty, loue hath conſtrained me to be yours. Then I pray you as affectuouſly as I may or can, that yee ceaſe your ſorrow, and that ye receiue mee as your friend and loue. The more ye weep the leſſe ye get and winne, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual teares or wéepinges, nor long laſting ſighes may neuer raiſe your father againe.</p>
                     <p>The faire Yole with theſe wordes was ſore oppreſſed with hote &amp; contrary imaginations, that her heart failed her. It was a piteous thing to beholde howe her friend Hercules would haue taken her vp and ſuſteined her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene his armes. But a wiſe lady that had alway go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned her, came to him and ſaid to him kneeling on her knees: Sir, I pray you in the name of all the Gods, that ye will ceaſe to ſpeake to this poore damſell for this time. She hath this day loſt her father, it muſt needs bée that nature acquite her. Ye may do with her your owne pleaſure, if ye let her a little abide in her melancholie: all ſhall be well if it pleaſe the Gods, as well for you as for her. At the requeſt of the Lady, Hercules was content to let her go for that time: hee recommended Yole vnto the Gods, and went vnto Theſeus for to paſſe his time with him: but to the end that Yole ſhoulde not go away nor eſcape, he ordained twelue Gréekes to kéepe her, and
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:7118:206"/>
commaunded vpon pains of death, that they ſhould ſuffer no woman to iſſue out of the chamber, without witting whither ſhe went. In this night Hercules did cauſe the dead bodies to be had out of the pallace, and the place to be made cleane. And alſo he ordeined that the body of the king Pricus ſhould be put in the ſepulture. When theſe things were acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pliſhed, Hercules &amp; Theſeus with their men of armes, made good chéere with ſuch as they found there: and Yole was neuer out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> remembrance of Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules. Yole certainely at this time was ſo diſcomforted, that it cannot be recounted. The ladie that had her in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernance, trauelled right ſore for to comfort and chéere her. Then when Hercules had left her in the chamber, as ſayd is, ſhe had many words to her: and among all other ſhe ſayd to her: My daughter, you wéepe too much. Ha ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame (ſayd Yole) how may I leſſe do? when ſhall I haue cauſe to wéepe and to waile if I haue not nowe? My fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is dead: I haue loſt him that moſt loued me of all the world. I may looſe no more, ne no greater thing. Ought not then my heart to be angry and ſorrowfull? My daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (ſayd the lady) I know well that ye haue the moſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant occaſion of ſorrowe that any woman may haue: but ſince it muſt néeds be that you paſſe by this infortune, what profite you your grieuous wéepings? There may nothing procéed of them but augmentation of melancoly, and hurting and appairing of your praiſed beautie. Ye be now fallen into the hand of this prince. This is a man worthy and noble aboue all other, he loueth you: ye ought to thanke the gods, and to giue them praiſe for this grace. For this is to you a good fortune, and an hap in your miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hap. If ye will be ruled by me, y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> ſhall take all this in good part. Better it is to ſuffer one euil then two. He thinketh ye ought to conſider your eſtate. And if ye conſider it well, ye ſhall indeuour you to forget it. Madame (ſayd Yole) Alas, and how may that be, that I ſhould haue loue or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitie or familiaritie with him that hath done to mee ſo
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:7118:207"/>
much harme. He hath not taken onely from me a knight, an vncle, nor a couſin: but mine onely proper father. Let none ſpeake to me thereof. Hee is, and ſhall be my mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall enemy, as long as I liue: and as long as he ſhal liue, he ſhall haue no more of me, for prayer, promiſe, nor for menace.</p>
                     <p>My daughter (ſayd the lady) make not your ſelfe bond, whereas you be free: the effects and déeds of loue be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till and ſudden. Loue is alway in his ſecret throne, that can doe none other thing, but humiliate, and méeken the hard hearted, and bow the ſtrong. So hard nor ſo ſtrong a heart is not amongſt the humaine creatures, but that it is right ſoone humbled and made méeke when that it is his pleaſure. There is no tower ſo high, but it may be beaten downe by ſubtill mining. Neither is no winde ſo great, nor ſo rigorous, but it may be tempered. There is no night ſo darke, but that it is ſurmounted with the day. Ye hate Hercules now, but if you haue a while kept com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie with him, and haue had communication with him, peraduenture you will loue him better then euer you lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued your father, your mother, or any other of your linage. And that I may proue by my ſelfe: for I had my huſband in ſo great hate firſt, ere we loued together, that I would faine haue ſéene him die a ſhamefull death. Shortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when we had begun to be acquainted one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I loued him ſo ſtedfaſtly, that if he had not beene with me day and night, I had thought I ſhould haue died for ſorrow and griefe. My daughter, ſuch be the chances of loue, that often times I ſay, after great hate commeth great loue. The glory of Hercules is ſo cléere, that your heart ought to be delighted therewith: the conqueſt that he hath made in this citie, ſhall be for you a ſingular pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration to all good. Would you attaine to a more grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter weale, then for to be fellow or loue of him that is the ſubduer of kings, the moſt beſt wel-faring man, and the moſt triumphant in armes? for to him is nothing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible:
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:7118:207"/>
hee hath conquered the moſt part of the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall world. O my daughter, reioyce you in fortune: ſhut not the doore to proſperitie that commeth to you: it is to be beléeued, that the deſolation of this citie, hath bene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed and ordeined by the parlement of the gods, in fauor of you, that are the paragon, and none like vnto you, of all the daughters of the kings, for to giue you in marriage vnto this man.</p>
                     <p>By theſe wordes the faire Yole had her ſtomacke ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed with ſundry imaginations. She roſe then vp from that part, and entred into her guardrobe, whereas was the preſentation of the goddeſſe Diana. When ſhe was come thither, ſhe knéeled downe in great humilitie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the image, and in abounding of ſighes, and weeping as ſore as ſhee had done any time of the day before, ſhee ſayd: Goddeſſe of virgines, what ſhall thy right ſimple ſeruant and handmayden doe? Alas, lighten mine hope, beholde mine affection, weigh my miſhappe. Send thine eyes into the ſecret of mine heart, and ſée the ſorrow that I beare, and in the fauour of virgines kéepe my bodie, and preſerue me fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the hand of him that would that I ſhould be his wife. Since that he had cauſed in me the roote of mortall hate, which is not poſſible to be rooted out, as nature iudgeth in mee (for it is not poſſible that I may loue mine enemie) I am therefore perſwaded, and it is trueth, that the hate that I haue againſt this tyrant Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules, ſhalbe euer abiding.</p>
                     <p>In theſe prayers and lamentations Yole abode vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the dead of the night, curſing Hercules, ſaying that ſhe had rather die then to loue or like him. Thus diſdai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the loue of Hercules, without meate or drinke ſhe paſſed the whole night. The day next following, Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules returned vnto her, and on a newe prayed her, that ſhe would be his wife: ſaying, without reſpite, that ſhe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> muſt needes agree thereto. She was right ſore diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant of this requeſt, and excuſed herſelf in many faſhions
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:7118:208"/>
that were too long to rehearſe at this time. But at the end of the praiers and requeſtes of Hercules, Loue inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in ſuch wiſe the gentlewoman, that ſhe vnderſtoode well that Hercules was of the roote of noble father and mother: wherefore ſhee accorded to doe his pleaſure. What ſhal I more ſay? Yole companied then with Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules as his wife, and they lay togither, and they grewe acquainted each with other. Loue then inrooted in their heartes, ſo that their two willes were locked and put in one will. Hercules forgot Deianira, and Yole forgat the death of her father, and was ſo much enamoured on Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules, that ſhe might reſt in no place, but that ſhe muſt be alway with him. O maruellous thing, the rancour and the hate that Yole had yeſterday vnto Hercules, is nowe ſodainly turned into loue infallible. For to ſpeede the matter: during yet the firſt dayes of the loue of Hercules and Yole, at the praier of Yole, Hercules gaue her ſiſters in marriage to certaine knightes of the Greekes, and left them there to gouerne the countrey and the realme of Calidonie. After he departed from thence, and brought his oxen and his kine with him, and ſent againe the king Euander into his dominion, thanking him of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and of the honour that he had done to him.</p>
                     <p>Euander woulde gladly haue accompanied Hercules into Greece: But Hercules would in no wiſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſhould haue the trauaile. At laſt then Euander (with great than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings of Hercules and of his armie) departed: and Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules with his armie went vnto the ſea, and hee forgat not behinde him the faireſt Yole, but hee loued her ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignly. All day he was with her, and ſhee pleaſed him as much as ſhee might, doubting more to looſe his loue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhe was ſory for the death of her father. Then as they thus went by the ſea, maintaining to their power the amorous life, Hercules encountered on a day, nigh by an hauen and a good citie, a gally of marchants. Hercules made the galley to tarry, and after called the maiſter, and
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:7118:208"/>
aſked of him what countrey he was, and from whence he came? Certes ſir (anſwered the maiſter of the galley) I departed late from the porte of Thrace that is hereby: I ſee well that ye be a ſtranger, and that yee know not the perill that ye be in: wherefore I haue pitie of you and of your company, and doe aduertiſe you, and wiſh you, that at the next hauen ye ſhal finde, in no wiſe yee tary there, for nothing that may befall you: for al ſo truely as yée bée héere, if ye go thither, yee ſhall take harme: for there is a king, a tyrant the moſt cruell that is in all the world, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Diomedes, that holdeth vnder him tenne thouſand théeues, and hee maketh warre againſt all them that hée may find, and hath a cuſtome that he putteth men to ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome ſuch as it pleaſeth him: and if they that hee putteth to ſuch miſery, pay their raunſome, hee letteth them go quiet, and with that money and ſubſtance, he nouriſheth his théeues, and his horſes. And if they cannot furniſhe their raunſome, He himſelf ſmiteth them to morſels, and giueth them to his horſes for to eate and deuoure. But there is one thing good for you, for this morning he is gone to the chaſe, for to hunt in a forreſt, which is a foure mile from Thrace, and with him there be an hundred of the ſtrongeſt theeues that he hath. And this knowe I of a trueth, for I haue ſeene them depart not paſſing three houres ago, &amp;c.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Ercules hearing theſe wordes that the mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the galley ſaid to him, and rehearſing the life of Diomedes, was paſſing ioyous in his heart, more then hee had béen ſince the death of the théef Cacus. He had in him that
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:7118:209"/>
valor, that where he might know a monſter or tyrant to be, or any men moleſting the weale, thither hee went, and ſuch tyrants hee deſtroyed: and to the ende that men ſhould not ſay, that he did ſuch workes for couetiſe, hee would neuer hold, nor retain to his proper vſe nothing of their goodes, but all that hee conquered in ſuch wiſe hee geue it vnto noble men, and praiſed nor ſought nothing but vertue. He would not make his ſeignorie to grow nor be inlarged, and take to himſelfe realme vppon realme. He was content with that, that nature had giuen him. And alway he woulde labour for the commonweale. O noble heart? O right well diſpoſed courage? O moſt ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous painym, there was none like to him of all them that were afore him, nor after him. For to holde on and go forward with my matter: when the maiſter had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſed him, as afore is ſaid, that the tyrant Diomedes was gone on hunting into the forreſt, with his hundred théeues, he enquired ſo much that the maiſter ſhewed him the ſituation of the foreſt, &amp; by what way and maner hée might ſooneſt come thither. After this, he gaue leaue to the maiſter to go his way. That done, he called his mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and made them to ſéeke the place. After, hee aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the Gréekes, and told them, that he would that they ſhould abide him there, and that he himſelfe without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay would go into the forreſt, that the maiſter had ſhewed him, to ſéeke Diomedes: ſaying, that he would neuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne into Greece vntill the time that hee had deliuered the countrey of this tyrant. Yole began then to wéepe, when ſhe heard the enterpriſe of Hercules, &amp; praied him, tenderly wéeping, that hee would leaue and depart from the hazard of ſo great perill. Hercules tooke no regard nor héed to her praiers. He deliuered to Phylotes his bowe &amp; his club, and entered into a little galley finely made and light. Which he guided by the helpe of Phylotes, right nigh the place where hee would be: and tooke land two bow ſhotte off, from the forreſt, and ſo in ſetting foot on
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:7118:209"/>
land, he heard the cry and noiſe of the hunting, and hadde thereof great ioy, and ſaid that he was well and where he would be. He tooke then his club, and left his bowe with Phylotes. After he entered into the forreſt, and had not far ranged in the forreſt, when hee found Dyomedes and his hundred theeues. Diomedes was the firſt that from far eſpied Hercules, and knew that he was a ſtranger<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; called to him and ſaid. Giant, what is it that thou ſeekeſt in this forreſt? Hercules anſwered, what art thou? Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes ſaide, I am the king of Thrace: thou art entered into my Dominion without my leaue: it diſpleaſeth me, and thou muſt be my priſoner, wherefore yeeld thée to mée. Hercules ſaid then: king, ſince thou art Diomedes the king of Thrace, thou art vndoubtedly the tyrant that I ſéeke. And therefore I am not of purpoſe to yeeld mée without ſtroke ſmiting, and eſpecially to an euill théefe. Know thou, that I will defend me with this club, with which I haue béen accuſtomed to deſtroy monſters, and am in hope this day, to make thy horſes eate and deuour thy body, like as thou haſt taught and vſed them to eate thy priſoners.</p>
                     <p>When Diomedes heard the anſwere of Hercules, hee tooke a great axe, that one of his theeues bare after him, and he lifted it vp, threatning Hercules vnto the death, and diſcharged ſo hard, that if Hercules had not turned the ſtroke with his club, he had béen in great perill. Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes was of the greatneſſe and ſtature of Hercules, and had aboundance of ſtrength and puiſſance. When Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules had receiued the ſtroke, he lifted vp his club, &amp; fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led not to ſmite Diomedes, for he gaue him ſuch a ſtroke vpon the ſtomacke, and ſo heauy that hee turned him vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide down from his horſe, and laid him all aſtonied in the field. Then his hundred theeues beſtirred them, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailed Hercules on all ſides. Some of them there were y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> recouered Diomedes, &amp; ſet him on his horſe, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other ſhot at Hercules: ſome brake their ſwordes on him. All this
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:7118:210"/>
impaired nothing the armes of Hercules. His halberd and his helme were of fine ſtéele forged &amp; tempered hard. He ſtood there among them like a mountaine. When hée had ſuffered the firſt ſkirmiſhe and aſſault of the théeues, for to ſhew to them with whom they fought, he ſet vppon them, and ſmote down right on all ſides with ſuch valor, that ſodainly he made the péeces of them flie into the wood, and ſmote them down from their horſes. Diomedes was at that time riſen, and with great furie and diſconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedneſſe, with many of his complices came vnto the reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kewe of his théeues, whom Hercules vſed as he would. And whiles that ſome aſſailed him before, he came behind, and ſmote him with his axe vpon his helme, the ſtroke wherof was ſo great that the fire ſprang out. Diomedes had well thought to haue murdered Hercules: yet Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules mooued not for the ſtroke, but a little bowed his head. After this then he lift vp his clubbe, and ſmote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the theeues, and maugre them all, in leſſe then an houre he had ſo belaboured the yron about their backs, that of the hundred hee ſlew ſixty, and the other hee al to bruſed and fruſhed and put to flight with Diomedes. But Hercules running more ſwiftly then an horſe, among all other purſued Diomedes ſo nigh, that hee raught him by the legge, and pulled him downe from his horſe, and caſt him downe againſt a tree vnto the earth. After hee tooke him by the body, and by maine force, bare him vnto the place where the battaile had béen. There he diſhelmed him and vnarmed him with little reſiſtance. For Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes was then all to bruiſed, and might not helpe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and when he hadde him thus at his will, hee bound him by the feete and by the handes. After this hee aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled togither twentie horſes of the théeues, that ran diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed in the wood, and came to Diomedes, and ſaide to him. O thou curſed enemy, that haſt emploied all thy time in tyrannie, and diddeſt neuer one good déed, but all thy daies haſt liued in multiplying of ſinnes and vices, and
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:7118:210"/>
haſt trobled the people by thefts &amp; praies irreparable, and that haſt nouriſhed thy horſes with mans fleſh, &amp; by this crueltie hadſt ſuppoſed to haue made me to die: Certes I will doe iuſtice vpon thée, and will doe to thine euill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, like as thou wouldeſt haue done to mine. Then Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules laid the tyrant in the middeſt of the horſes, which had great hunger, and they anon deuoured him, for they loued mans fleſh. And thus when Hercules had put the tyrant to death, hee tooke his armes, in ſigne of victory, and returned vnto Phylotes that abode him.</p>
                     <p>Philotes hadde great ioy, when hee ſawe Hercules re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, he enquired of him how he had done, and howe hee had borne him. And Hercules hid nor concealed nothing from him. What ſhall I ſay? with great ioy and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe they returned vnto the Greekes, and did cauſe to diſancre their ſhippes, and ſailed for to arriue at the port or hauen of Thrace. Then would Hercules make to bee known, &amp; publiſhed in Thrace y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> death of king Diomedes. Whereat was a great vproare. This notwithſtanding, Hercules tooke to Philotes the armes of Diomedes, and ſent him into the citie for to ſummon them that gouerned it, and for to yeeld it into his handes. Philotes went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the pallace of Thrace, and made to bee aſſembled them that then were principall in the Citie. When they were aſſembled, Phylotes did then open to them his charge and meſſage, and ſummoned the Thraciens, that they ſhoulde deliuer their citie into the handes of Hercules: Saying that Hercules was he that had put to death Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes for his euill liuing, and for the loue of the common weale: and that the citie could do no better but to receiue him at his comming, for hée woulde not pill it, but hee would only bring it to good pollicie. When he had done this ſummons, to the end that they ſhould beleeue him, he diſcouered and ſhewed vnto them the armes of Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes.</p>
                     <p>When the Thraciens heard Phylotes, and ſawe the
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:7118:211"/>
armes of Diomedes, ſome of the complices and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of Diomedes and theeues, were full of great rage, and would haue taken the armes from Phylotes. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that were wiſe and notable men, &amp; that many yeres had deſired the end of their king (ſeeing his armes) knew aſſuredly that Diomedes was dead, and full of ioy aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered to Philotes. Foraſmuch as Hercules was a king of great renowne and wiſedome, and that he had done a worke of great merite in the death of Diomedes they would receiue him with good hart into the citie. Without long diſcourſes, the Thraciens went vnto the gate, and opened it. Phylotes returned then vnto Hercules and tolde vnto him theſe tidinges. Hercules and the Gréekes went out of their Gallies, and entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Thrace in ſpace of time. The Thraciens brought them vnto the pallace where were yet many theeues. Hercules put all the theeues to death, not in the ſame night, but during the ſpace of ten daies that he ſoiourned there. He ſet the citie in good nature of pollicie. He deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered it from the euill théeues, hee made iudges by elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, at the pleaſure of the people. And then when hee hadde done all theſe thinges, hee departed from Thrace with great thanks, as well of the old as of the yong. Hée mounted vppon the Sea, and after by ſucceſſion of time without any aduenture to ſpeake of, he did ſo much that he came vnto his realme of Lycie, into his pallace, where he was receiued with great ioy of the inhabitantes, and alſo of the neighbours. And there he abode with the faire Yole, whom he loued aboue all temporall goodes.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Heſeus then, after the return of Hercules, ſeeing that he would abide there, and that there was no mention, that in all the world was any monſter nor tyrant, tooke leaue of his fellow Hercules, of Yole, of Phylotes, and of other, &amp; went to Athens, and to Thebes. Likewiſe the Gréekes tooke leaue, and euery man retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into his countrey, and to his houſe, recounting and telling in all the places where they went, the great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentures and the glorious workes of Hercules. Then the renowme that runneth and flieth by realmes and Empires as ſwiftly as the wind, ſo ſwiftly came vnto I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conie whereas Deianira ſoiourned, and it was ſaid to Deianira, that Hercules was returned from Spaine, with great glory and triumph, and that hee was deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into Lycia. Dame Deianira for this renowme, was glad, and all rauiſhed with a great and ſingular plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and concluded that ſhee woulde go vnto him. Yet ſhe was abaſhed for that he hadde not ſignified to her his comming, and that hee had not ſent for her, ſore penſiue and doubting, that ſhe ſhould be fallen out of the grace of Hercules. She made ready hir co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany, and in right noble eſtate ſhe departed from Iconie, on a day, for to go into Lycia. In proceſſe of time, ſhee came nigh vnto Licia. Then ſhe tarried there for to attire and array her in the beſt and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſt faireſt wiſe ſhée could or might, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led her ſquire named Lycas, and commaunded him that hee ſhoulde go into Licia, and ſignifie to Hercules her comming. At the commaundement of Deianira, Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas went forthwith into the Citie, and that happened
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:7118:212"/>
right at the gate, he encountered and mette a man of his acquaintance, a ſquire of Hercules. Lycas and the ſquire gréeted and ſaluted eche other. After this, Lycas aſked of the ſquire, and demaunded him, where the king was, and if he were in his pallace? yea verily ſaid the ſquire, he is there, I wote well, and paſſeth the time with his Lady Yole, the moſt beautifull, and out of meaſure moſt replendiſſant Lady that is in all the world, as great as it is. Eche man alloweth her, and praiſeth her a thouſand times more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Deianira. Hercules hath her in ſo much grace, that continually they be togither. And whatſoeuer the Lady doth, it is acceptable vnto Hercules: and there is no man that can ſay or tel the great loue that they haue togither.</p>
                     <p>Lycas hearing theſe tidinges of the ſquire, took leaue of him, and made ſemblance to haue let fall, or left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde him ſome of his gemmes or iewels: foraſmuch as he was of opinion in himſelfe, that it was good that he hadde aduertiſed her for his eſtate. Penſiue and ſimple he came to Deianira, where as ſhe was attyring her ſelfe pretiouſly, and ſaid to her. Madame what doe ye here? Wherefore anſwered Deianira? Therefore ſaide Lycas. Why is there any thing, ſaid Deianira? what tidinges? Lycas anſwered: hard tidings. I haue heard ſay and tell of Hercules, thinges full of ſuch hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that certes it is right greeuous to mee to ſay vnto you. Howbeit ſince that ye become thus farre, and that ye muſt needes know, and vnderſtand them: I tell and ſay to you certainly, that your Lord Hercules is in his pallace right ioyfully, and that hee hath with him a Ladie, faire by excellencie, whom he loueth and much delighteth in aboue all thinges, for her beautie, which is ſo high and great, that eche man maruaileth, and ſay, ſhe is the moſt ſoueraigne in beautie, that euer was ſéen with mans eie.</p>
                     <p>Beholde, and aduiſe you well, what ye will doe, ere
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:7118:212"/>
ye go any further: this day it is needfull to abide, and take councel and aduiſe.</p>
                     <p>At the hearing of theſe tidinges, Deianira was paſſing angry, and was all beſpread with a right great ſorrow in all her veines. She beganne to quake and tremble. Her faire haire that was finely dreſſed on her head, ſhee all to tare it with her hands in ſo furious maner, that ſhe diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyred her, and ſmote her ſelf with her fiſt to great a ſtroke vpon her breſt, that ſhe fell downe backward in a ſowne. The ladies and the gentlewomen that accompanied her ſhriked, and cried dolorouſly, and were ſore mooued at ſeeing her bloud. At length Deianira came to her ſelfe againe, all pale and wanne, and thinking on the ſorrow that engendred in her, and alſo on the ſorrow that was comming to her, ſhe ſpake, and ſaid with a feeble &amp; lowe voice. Poore Deianira what ſhalt thou doe? or whither ſhalt thou go? thou that findeſt thy ſelfe forſaken and put backe from the loue of thy lord Hercules? Alas, alas, is it poſſible that the new comming of a lady, may take away my huſband? The heart late ioyned to Deianira, ſhal it be diſioyned, by the finding of a woman of folly? ſhall ſhe make the ſeparation? I hope verily it may not be: For Hercules is noble of heart and loueth vertue: and if hée abandon and giue me ouer, he ſhal do againſt vertue and nobleneſſe. I haue affiance in him that hee will be true to me. Madame (ſaid Lycas) yee faile nothing to ſay that Hercules is noble and ful of vertue: for he hath emploied all his time in vertuous thinges: howbeit, he is a man, and hath taken in loue this new woman, for her beauty: affie not you ſo much in his vertue, leaſt your confidence beguile and deceiue you: know well that fortune enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth not long princes and princeſſes on the top aboue of her wheele: there is none yet ſo high, but that hee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them ſometime lie beneath among them that ſuffer trouble. Behold and ſee well what ye haue to doe. If yee go vnto Hercules, and he receiue you not as he hath béen
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:7118:213"/>
accuſtomed, that ſhall be to you a cauſe of deſpaire. Men ſay, that he loueth ſoueraignty this new lady: It is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant then, that hee ſhall ſet but a little ſtore by your comming: and if ye go, the Lady will be euill contente ſhe hath renowm, and euery man is glad to doe her plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. There ſhalbe no man ſo hardie to welcome you, for the loue of her. Go not thither then, the peril is too great: I councell you for the better, that ye returne into Ico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, and that ye heare this thing patiently, in attending and abiding vntill that the fire and the fume of this lady be quenched. For, whereas Hercules is al another ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of man then the moſt part of men be: ſo ſhal he leaue the loue of this lady a little and a little, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Deianira conſidering that Lycas councelled her tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, beléeued well this councel: and right ſore weeping ſhe returned into Iconie. When ſhe was in the houſe at Iconie, then ſhee depriued her ſelfe of all worldly pleaſure, and held her ſolitarily, without going to feaſts or to playes. Thus abiding in this ſolitude, her gréeuous annoy grew more and more, by ſo great vexations, that ſhe was conſtrained to make infinite bewaylinges and ſighes. The continuall comfort of her ladies might giue to her no ſolace. The innumerable ſpéeches that they v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vnto her eares, for to make her paſſe the time might neuer take away Hercules out of her minde. She paſſed and liued many daies this life, hauing alway her eare o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen for to know if Hercules ſent for her. In the end whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhe had wayted long, and ſawe that nothing came, and that neither man nor woman was comming to bring her tidinges from the perſon of Hercules, ſhee made a letter, which ſhe deliuered to Lycas, for to beare vnto Hercules, and charged him to deliuer it to no perſon, but to the proper hand of him that ſhee ſent it vnto. Lycas tooke the letter, and went vnto Licie, and two mile fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the citie, hee met Hercules in a croſſe way. Hercules came from Archadie, where he had newly ſlaine a wilde
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:7118:213"/>
bore, ſo great that there was neuer none ſéen like to him. When then Lycas ſaw Hercules, hee made to him reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and preſented his letter to him, ſaluting him from Deianira. Hercules waxed red, and chaunged colour, when he heard ſpeake of Deianira. He receiued the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter amiably and read it, and found therein conteined, as as here followeth.</p>
                     <p>Hercules my Lord, the man of the world that I moſt deſire, I humbly beſéech &amp; earneſtly intreat you, that you haue regard to your true ſeruant and vnworthy louer Deianira. Alas Hercules, alas. Where is become the loue of the time paſt? yee haue nowe ſoiourned manie daies in Licie, &amp; ye haue let me haue no knowledge ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Certes, that is to mée a right dolorous griefe to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer and beare: for I deſire not to be deified nor to mount into the celeſtiall manſions, with the ſunne, with the moone, nor with the ſtarres, but without faining or breaking of a free heart, I deſire your ſolemne commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication. I may from henceforth no more faine. It is ſaid to me that you haue another wife beſides mee. Alas Hercules haue I made any fault againſt your worthines? wherefore giue yee me ouer and abandone me? Howe may ye do ſo? men name you the man vertuous. Yee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon me and forſake me: and that is againſt vertue. Though now yee doe it, I haue ſeene the time that yee were my huſband, in embracing vs togither, and kiſſing, you ſhewed then to me ſemblance of good liking &amp; of ioy. Now, let ye her alone that ye loued, as a poore caſtaway. Alas where be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> witneſſes of our mariage? where be the eternal vowes &amp; othes that we made one to another. Men bée deafe &amp; blinde, but the Gods heare and ſee: wherefore I pray you, that ye conſider, that which ye ought to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: and that ye hold your good name more deerer, than ye do the loue of your new acquainted goſſip that maketh you to erre againſt vertue, whereof ye haue ſo great a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowm, &amp; I pray you hastily write to me your pleaſure, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="416" facs="tcp:7118:214"/>When Hercules hadde read from the beginning to the end, the letter of Deianira, as hee yet beheld and ſawe it, Yole came vnto him, with three hundred gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, for to bee merrie, and to make cheere with Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules. Hercules then cloſed the letter, and returned into Licie, holding Yole by the hand: howbeit when he was in his pallace, he forgot not Deianira, but found meanes for to go into his ſtudie, and there wrote a letter: and when it was finiſhed, he tooke it to Lycas, for to preſent it to Deianira. Lycas tooke the letter and returned home againe to Deianira. Firſt he told her the tidinges, and of the ſtate of Yole. After he deliuered to her the letter, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teining, that he recommended him vnto her, and that hée hadde none other wife but her, and that hee praied her that ſhee woulde not giue her to thinke any euill, but to liue in hope and in patience, as a wiſe ladie and noble ought, and is bound to doe, for her honour and credite. This letter little or nought comforted Deianira, ſhe was ſo vehemently attainted with ielouſie. Her ſorrowe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled and grew. In this redoubling, ſhe wrote yet an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other letter, which ſhe ſent to Hercules, and that contei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned theſe wordes that follow.</p>
                     <p>Hercules, alas and what auaileth me to be the wife of ſo noble a huſband as ye be? your nobleneſſe is to mee more hurtfull then profitable. O fortune, I was woont to reioyce, for all day I heard none other things but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations and praiſinges of your proweſſes and right glorious deedes and exploites, wherwith the world was inlumined and ſhone.

<pb n="417" facs="tcp:7118:214"/>
in the priſe of Calidonie, and yet now ſhee hath the place of your lawfull wife. Alas, haue I ſayd well, married? for to be named the faire daughter of Iupiter king of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and of the earth? Now ſhall I no more be called ſo, it is not alway happy to mount vnto the moſt high eſtate. For from as much as I haue mounted in height, and was your fellowe, from ſo farre I feele my ſelfe fall into the more great perill. O Hercules, if for my beautie ye tooke me to your wife, I may well curſe that beautie: for that is cauſe of the grieuous ſhame, that is to me all euident, for to prognoſticate mine harme and ill to come. And that is to come, cannot your aſtronomers ſée that? I would I knew that. I wote well your beautie and my beauty haue brought my heart into the ſtrait priſon of ſorrow with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end. And I may not count them but for enemies, ſince by them all ſorrowes come vnto me. The ladies haue ioy in the preheminence of their huſbands, but I haue ill for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune and miſhappe. I ſée nothing but diſpleaſure in my marriage. O Hercules, I thinke all day on you, that ye go in great perils of armes, and of fierce beaſts, and tempeſts of the ſea, and in the falſe perils of the world. Mine heart trembleth, and hath right great feare of that I ought to haue comfort and hope of wealth. All that I remember in my minde, and thinke on in the day, I dreame on in the night: and then me thinketh verily, that I ſee the cutting ſharpe ſwords enter in me, and the heads of the ſpeares: and after mee thinketh, that I ſée iſſue out of the caues of the forreſts and deſerts, lyons, and wilde monſters, that eaſe my fleſh. Since the beginning of our aliance vnto this day, I haue had all the dayes and nights ſuch paines for you, and borne and ſuffered them. But alas, all theſe things are but little in compariſon of the paines that I now ſuffer and endure, foraſmuch as ye maintein ſtrange women, and a woman of all folly.

Certes they would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute them woorthie to be vanquiſhed of thee, and would ſhewe and point at thee with their fingers, as at a man ſhamed, and made like a woman, liuing in the lappe of a woman. O how ſtrong is Yole? when her handes that are not woorthie nor meet to threed a needle, hath taken thy clubbe, and brandiſhed thy ſwoord wherewith thou haſt put in feare all the earth? Alas Hercules, haue you not in remembrance that in your childhood, lying in your cradle, ye ſlew the two ſerpents. You being a childe were a man, and now when you haue beene a man, are you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a woman, or a childe? This is the worke of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, to holde himſelfe alway with a woman: or, it is the deede of a childe, for to enamour himſelfe on a woman of follie. The trueth muſt be ſayd, you began better then you end: your laſt deedes aunſwere not the firſt, your labours ſhall neuer be aunſwerable nor woorthie your praiſings nor your lands. For all the commendation &amp; praiſing is in the end. Whoſoeuer he be that beginneth a worke, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the beginning is faire, &amp; the end foule, all is loſt. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Hercules, when I beholde the glorious beginning that vertue made in you, and ſee that you now be vitious, all
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:7118:215"/>
my ſtrength faileth, and mine armes fall downe as a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in a trance or a ſwoune, and without ſpirit: and it may not ſéeme to me true, that thoſe armes (that bare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by force the ſhéepe from the garden, belonging to the daughters of Athlas) may fall into ſo great a fault, as for to embrace and beclip fleſhly another wife then his owne. This notwithſtanding, I am aſſured of a trueth, that you hold not caitife Yole, as a caitife, but as your owne wife: not in priſon, but at her pleaſure, in chamber finely be dec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and in bedde curteined and hanged: not diſguiſed and ſecretly, as many holde their concubines: but openly and with ſhameleſſe face ſhewing herſelfe right glorious to the people, &amp; as that ſhe may ſo do lawfully. For ſhe hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth you priſoner and caitife, and ſhe hath put the fetters about your necke, by her Italian iuglings &amp; ſhifts, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I haue great ſhame in my ſelfe. But as for the amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I will diſcharge my minde, I cannot better it, but pray to the gods that they will puruey for remedie.</p>

By this remorſe, he vnderſtood that vertue was ſtained in him: he was then very penſiue, and ſo much depriued from all pleaſure, that none durſt come to him in a great while and ſpace, ſaue onely they that brought to him meate and drinke. Neither Yole durſt not go to him, Licas that had brought this letter, was there waiting and attending

the anſwere long. No man could know whereof procéeded the penſiueneſſe of Hercules, nor the cauſe why hee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew himſelfe from the people. In the end, when Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les had bene long penſiue, and had thought vpon all his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, and what he had to doe: for to withdraw himſelfe, and to get himſelfe from Yole, he departed from his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber on a day, ſaying, that hee would go and make ſacrifice to the god Apollo, vpon the mount named Oeta, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and forbade, vppon paine of death, that no man ſhould follow him except Phylotes. By aduenture, as he iſſued out of his pallace, accompanied onely with Phylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, for to go vpon the mount, he met Licas. Licas made to him reuerence, and demanded of him, if it pleaſed him any thing to ſend to Deianira. Hercules anſwered to Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas, that he would go make his ſacrifice to the god Apollo, and that at his returne and comming againe, he would go vnto her, or els he would ſend vnto her.</p>
                     <p>With this word Hercules and Phylotes paſſed foorth, and went on their pilgrimage. And Licas returned vnto Deianira, and tolde to her the ioyfull tidings that he had receiued of Hercules, and alſo what life Hercules had lead ſince the day and the houre that he had preſented to him her letter. Deianira all comforted with theſe good ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, went into her chamber, and thanked the gods, and fortune. Anon after, ſhe beganne to thinke on her eſtate, and thus thinking, ſhe remembred her of the poiſon that Neſſus had giuen her, being at the point of death, &amp; how ſhe had kept it in one of her coffers: and forthwith incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently ſhe opened the coffer, and tooke the curſed poiſon, and one of the ſhirts of Hercules: and as ſhee that imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the vertue of the poiſon to draw againe to her the loue of Hercules, like as Neſſus had ſayde vnto her, ſhée made the ſhirt to be boiled with the poiſon, and gaue the charge thereof to one of her women. When the ſhirt was boiled enough, the woman tooke the veſſell, and ſet it to coole. After ſhe tooke out the ſhirt openly, and wrong it, but
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:7118:216"/>
ſhe could not ſo ſoone haue wrung it, but the fire ſprang in hir handes ſo vehemently, that as ſhee caſt it vppon a pearch to drie, ſhee fell downe dead.</p>
                     <p>In proceſſe of time, Deianira deſiring to haue the ſhirt, and ſeeing the woman that hadde charge thereof, brought it not, ſhée went into the chamber where the ſhirt had béen boiled, and found the woma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> dead, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſhe had great maruaile. Neuertheleſſe ſhee paſſed the death lightly, and by one of her damſels ſhée made take the ſhirt that hanged on the pearch and was drie, and commaunded her that ſhée ſhould folde it and winde it in a handkerchiefe.</p>
                     <p>At the commaundement of Deianira the damoſell fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and wrapped the ſhirt. But ſo doing, ſhe was ſerued with the poyſon in ſuch wiſe that ſhe loſt her ſpeech, and died anon after. This notwithſtanding Deianira that thought on nothing, but for to come to her intention, took the ſhirt, and deliuered it to Lycas, and charged him that he ſhould beare it to Hercules, praying him in her name, that he would weare it. Lycas, that was ready to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh the will of his miſtreſſe, tooke the charge of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous ſhirt, and departed from thence, and went into the mountaine whereas Hercules was, and there hee found him in a forreſt, whereas was the temple of Diana: Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules hadde no man with him but Phylotes, which made ready for him a great fire for to ſacrifice an hart that Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules had taken running at a courſe. Lycas then finding Hercules in the temple, hee kneeled downe lowe to him, and ſaid, Sir, here is a ſhirt that your waiting woman and ſeruaunt Deianira ſendeth vnto you. Shee recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth her humbly vnto your good grace, and praieth you that ye will receiue this preſent in good part, as from your wife. Hercules was ioyous of theſe wordes, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non vnclotheth him, for to doe on this curſed ſhirt. Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that verily ſhe was his wife, and that he woulde for her ſake weare this ſhirt. In doing on this ſhirt, he felt a
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:7118:217"/>
great dolour and paine in his bodie. This notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, he did on his other clothes aboue, as hee that thought none euill. When he was clothed and the ſhirt was warme, his paine and ſorrow grew more and more. Then he began to thinke, and knew anon that his mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die came of his ſhirt, and feeling the pricking of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim, without long tarrying, he tooke off his robe, &amp; ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to haue taken off his ſhirt from his backe, and to haue rent it, and ſpoiled it. But he was not ſtrong enough for to doe ſo, for the ſhirt held ſo ſore, and cleaued ſo faſt and terribly to his fleſhe, and was ſo faſtened to his ſkin, by the vigour of the ſharpe poyſon, in ſuch wiſe that hee tare out his fleſh, and bare away certaine péeces thereof, when he would haue taken off his ſhirt, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Hercules knew then, that hee was hurt and wounded to the death. Death began to fight againſt him, he began to reſiſt by drawing of his ſhirt from his body with péeces of his fleſh and of his bloud, but al might not auaile. He al to rent and tare his backe, his thies, his body vnto his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trailes and guttes, his armes, his ſhoulders vnto the bones, and ſtill his dolour and paine grewe and inlarged to be more and more. Thus as he returned, in the force of his great dolorous paine, hee beheld Lycas and another fellow that he had brought with him, that were all aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed of this aduenture. Then he went to them, and ſaid vnto Lycas. Thou curſed and vnhappie man: what thing hath mooued thée to come hither vnder the falſe friendſhip of Deianira, to bring me into the chaunce of this miſfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune: What thinkeſt thou, that thou haſt done? Thou haſt ſerued mee with a ſhirt intoxicate with mortall ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim. Who hath introduced thee to doe this? thou muſt needes receiue thy deſert. And ſaying theſe wordes, Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules caught by the head poore Lycas, that wiſt not what to ſay, and threwe him againſt a rocke ſo fierſly, that he to fruſhed and all to brake his bones, and ſo ſlew him. The fellow of Licas fledde, and hid him in a buſhe. Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotes
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:7118:217"/>
was ſo afraid, that hee will not what to do. At the houre that Hercules was in this caſe, much people came into the temple. The entrailes of Hercules were trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled. His bloud boyled in all his veines, the poiſon pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced vnto his heart, his ſinowes ſhrunke and withdrewe them. When he felt himſelfe in this miſerie, and that death haſted his end by terrible paine, as hee that coulde not take away the repugnance of his vertuous force, ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing againſt the malice of venom, hee began to runne, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer hill, and ouer valey, vp and downe the forreſt, and pulled vp the great trees and ouerthrew them. After, he began to rent off his ſhirt, with the fleſh that was ſodden and broiled. When he had long lead this life, he returned vnto the temple, all aſſured of death, &amp; lift vp his hands and eies vnto the heauen, and ſaid: Alas, alas <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

O Deianira, what haſt thou done?

that glorified her in thy glory, and put and ſet thee in the front of their honour, as a carbuncle for the decking of their pretious thinges? In ſtéede to ſet thee in the front, they ſhall caſt thee vnder féete, and in ſteed to haue glory of thee, they ſhall haue ſhame: hereof they may not faile, for by impietie and diuerſe engines, and by conſpired and ſwollen crueltie, thou haſt conſpired my death, and haſt broched and vnfolded, not recurable miſfortune, for thée and me, and for our friendes and kinſmen.

By thine offence and by thy miſchieuous ſleight hid and couert, where from I could not keepe mee, I muſt die and paſſe out of this world. Since it is ſo, I thanke fortune, and aſke of the Gods no vengeance of thee: but certes to the end it bee not ſaid, that the vanquiſher of man, he not vanquiſhed by a woman, I will not paſſe the bitter paſſage of death by thy mortall ſorce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Theſe dolorous, and ſorrowfull wordes accompliſhed, Hercules tooke his clubbe, and caſt it in the fire, that was made readie for to make his ſacrifice. After hee gaue to Philotes his bowe and his arrowes, and then hee praied him, that he would recommend him to Yole, and to his friendes: and then feeling that his life had no longer for to ſoiourne, hee tooke leaue of Phylotes and then, as all burnt and ſodden, hee laide him downe in the fire, lifting his handes &amp; his eies vnto the heauen, and there conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated the courſe of his glorious life: Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Phylotes ſaw the end of his maiſter Hercules, hee burnt his body to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes, and kept thoſe aſhes in intention to beare them to the temple that the king Euander had cauſed to make. After, he departed from thence, and returned into Licia,
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:7118:218"/>
greatly diſcomforted: and with a great fountain of teares he recounted to Yole and to his friends the pitious death of Hercules. No man could recount the great ſorow that Yole made, and they of Licia, as well the ſtudentes as rurall people. All the world fell in teares, in ſighes, and in bewailinges for his deathe. So muche abounded Yole in teares and weepinges, that her heart was as drowned, and forthwith departed her ſoule from the body by the bitter water of her wéeping. Eche body cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and ſpake ſhame of Deianira. Finally, Deianira ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſed by the fellow of Lycas of the miſchiefe that was come by the ſhirt, ſhe fell in deſpaire, and made many be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailinges: and among all other ſhe ſaide, What haue I done? Alas, what haue I done? The moſt notable man of men, ſhining among the clerkes, hee that trauerſed the ſtraunge coaſtes of the earth and hell: hee that bodily conuerſed among men, and ſpiritually among the ſun, the moone and the ſtarres, and that ſuſtained the circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the heauens, is dead, by my cauſe, &amp; by my fault, and without my fault. He is dead by my fault: for I haue ſent to him the ſhirt that hath giuen to him the taſte of death. But this is without my fault: for I knew nothing of the poiſon. O mortall poiſon. By me is he depriued of his life, of whom I loued the life aſmuch as I did mine owne. Hee that bodily dwelled among the men heere on earth, and ſpiritually aboue with the ſunne, the moone and celeſtiall bodies: He that was the fountaine of Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, by whom the Atheniens arrowſed and bedewed their wits and ſkils: hee that made the monſters of the ſea to tremble in their abiſmes and ſwallowes, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroied the monſters of hell: He confounded the monſters of the earth, the tyrantes hee corrected, the inſolent and proud he humbled and meeked: The humble and meeke he enhaunſed and exalted: He that made no treaſour but of vertue: he that ſubdued al the nations of the world and conquered the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with his club: and he that if he had would,

richeſt Pallaces and ſtrongeſt that euer was in all the world. And it was of height fiue hundred paſes, beſides the height of the Towers, whereof was great plentie, and ſo high that it ſéemed to them that ſawe them from farre they raught vnto the heauen. And in this riche pallace, the king Priamus did make the richeſt hall that was at that time in the worlde: within which was his rich Throne, and the table whereupon hee did eate and held his eſtate among his Lordes and Barons: and all that longed thereto, was of gold and of ſiluer, of pretious ſtones, and of Iuorie.</p>
                     <p>In this hall, at one corner, was an altar of golde and pretious ſtones, which was conſecrated in the name and worſhip of Iupiter their God, to which altar went men vp twentie degrees or ſteppes. And vpon the altar was the Image of Iupiter of fifteene foote of height, all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet and and arraied with pretious ſtones. For in that God Iupiter was all the hope and truſt of the king Pria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, for to hold his raigne long, and in all proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>When he ſawe that he hadde ſo faire a Citie, ſo ſtrong and ſo well peopled, and with that ſo rich of goodes, hee beganne to take ſome diſpleaſure at the wrongs that the Greekes had done vnto him, and thought long howe hée might reuenge him. Then hée aſſembled on a certaine day all his Barons, and helde a riche Court. At this Court Hector his eldeſt ſonne was not, for hee was in the parties of Pannony, on the affaires and certain works of his father, foraſmuch as Pannonie was ſubiect vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the king Priamus. When king Priamus ſaw all his folke aſſembled and gathered before him, hee beganne to ſpeake, ſaying in this manner. O men and true friends, that bée partners of my great iniuries to mée done by the Greekes, for ſo little a cauſe or treſpaſſe: Yée knowe howe the Greeks by their pride haue come into this countrey, and haue ſlaine cruelly your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:7118:225"/>
and friendes, and alſo mine. And how they haue taken and ledde away, and holde in ſeruitude Exione my ſiſter, that is ſo faire and noble, and yet they holde her as a common woman. Ye knowe wel, how they haue bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten downe, and deſtroied this Citie, ouerthrowne the walles, the Pallaces and houſes, vnto the foundations, and haue borne away the great riches, whereof the Citie was full. And for theſe things I think it ſhould be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that by the helpe of the Gods, who reſiſt thoſe that bée inſolent and proud, wee altogither by a common ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord ſhoulde take vengeance of theſe iniuries. Ye know what Citie wee haue, and howe it is peopled with good men of arms, and fighters: and garniſhed with all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of goodes and riches.</p>
                     <p>Alſo ye know well, the alliances that wee haue with many right great Lords, that with good wil wil help vs, if néede hee. Wherefore, me ſéemeth, that it ſhoulde bée good for vs to reuenge vs of this ſhame. But yet foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the aduentures of the warres be right doubtfull and daungerous, and that no man knoweth what may come thereof (albeit that the iniurie be great, and that they hold my ſiſter in ſo great diſhonour) yet will I not begin the warre: But firſt, if yée thinke good, I will ſend of the moſt ſage and prudent men that I haue, to pray and require them, that they render and yéeld againe my ſiſter Exione: and I will be content to pardon all the other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>When the king hadde thus finiſhed his wordes, all allowed and praiſed his aduiſe, and it ſéemed to them good. And then the king Priamus immediately called one of his Princes, named Anthenor, and earneſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired him, and vſed courteous and gentle perſwaſions, that hée woulde enterpriſe this ambaſſage forthwith into Greece. And Athenor with all humilitie aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him, that hee was alwaies readie to doe his good pleaſure. Then was there a ſhip made ready, and all that
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:7118:226"/>
belongeth and was conuenient to bring Anthenor into Greece. He entered into the ſhippe, and his men, and ſailed ſo long, that they arriued at the porte of Theſſaly, whereas was then by aduenture the king Peleus, that receiued right ioyfully enough Anthenor, and demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of him, wherefore hee was come into thoſe partes. Anthenor anſwered to him in this maner. Sir, ſaid he, I am a meſſenger of the king Priamus, that hath ſent mee to you, and hath commanded me to ſay to you and other, that he is well remembred of the great iniuries that yee and other haue done to him, that for ſo little cauſe or occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, haue ſlaine his father, deſtroied his citie, and his people ſome dead and ſome in ſeruitude. And yet that is worſe to holde his ſiſter foully as a concubin, and yet at leaſt he ought to haue wedded her. And foraſmuch as yée be a man of great witte and diſcretion, the king my lord wiſheth you and warneth you, that from henceforth yee ceaſe the rage and the great ſlaunders that may come for this cauſe, that all good men ought to eſchewe to their power &amp; that his ſiſter be ſafely deliuered again to him: and he will pardon the reſidue, and wil hold it as a thing that neuer had happened, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>When the king Peleus had heard Anthenor ſo ſpeak, hee chafed with him anon in great anger and ire, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to blame the king Priamus, and ſaid, that his wit was light. And after, menaced Anthenor, and commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him that he ſhould go anon out of his land: for if hee tarried long there, hée woulde flea him with great tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes.</p>
                     <p>Anthenor taried not long after, but entered into his ſhippe without taking leaue of king Peleus, and ſailed ſo farre by the ſea, that he arriued at Salamine, where the king Thelamon ſoiourned. Then Anthenor went vnto him, and declared to him the cauſe of his comming in this maner. Sir (ſaid hee) the king Priamus reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth effectuouſly your nobleneſſe, that his ſiſter Exione,
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:7118:226"/>
whom ye holde in your ſeruice ſo foully, ye would reſtore vnto him. For it is not fitting nor ſeemly vnto your glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie nor renowne, to vſe ſo the daughter and ſiſter of a king, and that is iſſued of a more noble ligne then yée bée. And in caſe that ye will reſtore to him his ſiſter, hee will hold all thinges as not done, as well the damages, as the diſhonours that by you and other haue beene done vnto him.</p>
                     <p>When the king Thelamon hadde heard Anthenor ſo ſpeake, hee beganne to waxe paſſing angry, and aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered to him right fierſly, ſaying: My friend (ſaide hee) whatſoeuer thou bee, I haue much maruaile of the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleneſſe of thy king, to whom I beare none amitie, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he to mee. And therefore I ought not to hearken vnto his praier nor requeſt. Thy king ought to knowe that I and other haue béen there for to reuenge an iniurie, that his father Laomedon did late to ſome of our friendes, And foraſmuche as I then entered firſt into the citie of Troy with great trauaile &amp; effuſion of my bloud, Exione of whom thou ſpeakeſt, which is right faire, was giuen vnto mée for the guerdon of my victorie, for to do with her my will.</p>
                     <p>And forſomuch as ſhee is ſo well to my pleaſure as ſhée that is of great beautie, and repleniſhed with all Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: it is not to me ſo light a thing to render and deliuer againe a thing that is ſo faire and delightfull, which I haue conquered with ſo great paine and daunger. But thou ſhalt ſay to thy king, that hée may neuer recouer her, but by the point of the ſword: but as for me, I repute thée for a foole, that euer wouldeſt enterpriſe this meſſage, wherein lieth thy great perill: for thou art come among people that vehemently hate thée and thy like: therefore go thy way haſtily out of this countrey. For if thou abide any more here, I will make thée die by cruell and hateful death, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>When Anthenor heard Thelamon ſo ſpeake, hee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered

right haſtily into his ſhip, and ſailed ſo farre, that hée arriued in Theſſalie, where the king Caſtor and the king Polux his brother ſoiourned. Hée went a ſhore ſpéedily from his ſhippe, and declared his meſſage, like as hée had done to the other. And the king anſwered to him in great yre, and ſaid to him thus. Friend (what that thou art) I will that thou knowe, that wée thinke not to haue iniuried the king Priamus without cauſe: for it is ſo that the king Laomedon his father then beganne the folly, wherefore he was ſlaine. For he wronged firſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of the Nobles of Greece, and therefore wee deſire more the euill will of thy king Priamus, then his good loue or peace. And certes it ſéemeth well y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he had not thée in anie good reckoning when hée ſent thee hither to doe this meſſage in this countrey: wherefore I wiſhe thée, ſee well that thou abide not here long, for if thou go not incontinent, thou ſhalt die villanouſly. Then Anthenor departed without leaue, and entered into his ſhippe, and ſailed till hee came to Pilon, where the duke Neſtor ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iourned, with a great company of noble men. Anthenor went vnto him and ſaide, that hee was meſſenger of the king Priamus, and tolde and counted to him his meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, in ſuch wiſe as hee hadde ſaide to the other before. And if the other were angry, this Neſtor chafed in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe more againſt Anthenor, and ſaid to him. Ha, ha, vile varlet, who made thee ſo hardie for to ſay ſuch thinges before me? Certes, if it were not, that my nobleneſſe refraine me, I woulde anon cauſe thy tongue to be pluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked out of thy head, and in deſpite of thy king, I would by force of horſe cauſe to draw thy members one from an other. Go thy way haſtily out of my ſight: or by my Gods, I will cauſe to bee done, all that I haue heere ſaid, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Then Anthenor was all abaſhed, at the horrible words of Duke Neſtor, and doubting the furie of his tyrannie, returned vnto the Sea, and ſette him on his returne to
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:7118:228"/>
Troy ward. And hee hadde not been long on the Sea, when a great tempeſt aroſe, and the aire began to waxe darke, and to raine and to thunder right maruellouſly, and there roſe great windes contrary, and waxed thicke and horrible miſtie, and his ſhippe was borne on the waues, one time high, and another time lowe, in great perill, and there was not a man in the ſaide ſhippe, but ſuppoſed to die, and that made not ſpeciall promiſes and vowes to their Gods, and in theſe perilles were they three dayes, and on the fourth day the tempeſt ceaſed, and and the aire waxed all cléere, and became peaceable. Then they comforted themſelues, and ſayled ſo farre that they came to the port of Troy, and went ſtraite to their Temples, to giue then thankes to their Gods for that they hadde eſcaped ſo manie perilles as they hadde been in. And after Anthenor went with a great companie of noble men before the king Priamus, and when all the Barons were aſſembled, and all the ſonnes of the king preſent, then Anthenor tolde all by order, what hee had done in Gréece, like as it is contained heretofore. At theſe tidinges was king Priamus ſore troubled, and greeued for the opprobrious tauntes that they had offered to his meſſenger in Greece. And then he had no more hope nor truſt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer his ſiſter.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen the king Priamus was thus acertained of the hate of the Greekes, and by no farre meanes hee coulde recouer his ſiſter, hee was mooued with great ire, and thought that hee would ſend a great Nauy into Greece, for to hurt and da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage the Greckes. Alas king Priamus, tell me, what miſaduenture is this, that hath giuen to thée ſo great har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe of courage, for to caſt out thy ſelfe from thy wealth and reſt? Why mayeſt not thou refraine the firſt moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinges of thy courage? albeit that it was not in thy puiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance, yet thou oughteſt to haue and take good councell and aduiſe, and to haue in thy minde that men ſay com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly: Some man thinketh to reuenge his ſorrow, and he increaſeth it.</p>
                     <p>It had been a more ſure thing to thee, to haue remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred the prouerbe that ſaith, that hee that ſitteth well, let him not mooue. Or els, hee that is well at his eaſe, let him keep therein. All things may bée ſuffered ſaue wealth: a man that goeth vpon plaine ground, hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſtumble at. In this maner the aforeſaid king Priamus thought long, and after hee aſſembled on a day all his noble men in his pallace of Ilion, and ſaide vnto them. Ye know, how by your councell, Anthenor was ſent into Greece for to recouer my ſiſter Exione, &amp; that by fair meanes. Ye doe verie well know alſo, howe that hee is returned and come backe, and alſo what wronges
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:7118:229"/>
and opprobries he hath found? And me ſeemeth that the Gréeks make little account of the iniuries that they haue done vnto vs, at the leaſt, they by their wordes repent them not, but yet they menace vs more ſtrongly then euer they did. God forbid that euer it ſhoulde come vnto vs, like as they menace vs. But I pray the gods to giue vs power to auenge vs to their loſſe. And as for me, me ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that we be more puiſſant and ſtrong then they are, and alſo we haue the moſt ſureſt citie, and the beſt furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in the world: and alſo we haue of great lordes verie great plentie alied to vs, for to helpe and ayde vs at our need: and I thinke for concluſion, that we haue well the puiſſance for to dammage and hurt our enemies in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny maners, and valour to defend vs from them. And ſo ſhould it be good, for to beginne to ſhew to them what pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſſance we haue, to grieue them withall. If ye thinke it good, we will ſend our men ſecretly, that ſhall do to them great dammage, ere that they ſhall be readie for to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themſelues. And for that ye ought euery one to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy your ſelues to take vengeance of theſe iniuries, and that yee haue no doubt for any thing, inaſmuch as they had the firſt victorie: for it happeneth often times that the conquerours be vanquiſhed of them that were van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Then all they that were preſent, allowed the aduiſe of the king, and offered euery man by himſelfe, to employ themſelues to the ſame with all the power they coulde: whereat the king Priamus had great ioy. And after that he had giuen them thankes, he let euery man depart and go home to their owne houſes, excepting onely his ſonnes legitimate, and the baſtardes whom hee held in his pallace, and tolde to them his complaint of the Greekes with weeping teares, in this maner: My ſonnes, ye haue well in your memorie the death of your Grandfather, the ſeruitude of your Aunt Exione, that they holde by your life in manner of a common woman. And you be
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:7118:230"/>
ſo puiſſant, me ſeemeth that reaſon ſhould inſtruct you, for to employ your ſelfe to reuenge this great iniurie and ſhame. And if this mooue you not thereto, yet yee ought to doe it to ſatiſfie my will and pleaſure: for I am ready to die for ſorrow and anguiſh, which ye ought &amp; be bound for to remedie to your power, that haue cauſed you ſo wel to be nouriſhed and brought forth. And thou Hector, my right déere ſonne, that art the eldeſt of thy brethren, the moſt wiſe and the moſt ſtrong, I pray thee firſt, that thou enterpriſe to put in execution this my will. And that thou be duke and prince of thy brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this work, and all the other will obey gladly vnto thee. And in like maner ſhall all they doe of this realme, for the great proweſſe that they know in thée. And know, that from this day forth I diſcharge me of all this worke, and put it vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thée that art the moſt ſtrong and mightie to maintain battels: for I am auncient and olde, and may not from henceforth helpe my ſelfe, ſo well as I was wont to doe, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>To theſe wordes aunſwered Hector right ſoberly and ſweetly, ſaying, my father, and my right déere and Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Lord, there is none of all your ſonnes, but that it ſéemeth to him a thing humane, to deſire vengeaunce of theſe iniuries, and to vs that be of high nobleneſſe, a litle iniurie ought to be great. As it is ſo that the qualitie of the perſon groweth and diminiſheth, ſo ought the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the iniurie. And if wee be deſirous and haue appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite to take vengeance of our iniuries, we forſake not, nor leaue therein the nature of men: for in like manner doe and vſe the dumbe beaſtes to boo, and nature it ſelfe teacheth and guideth them thereto. My right déere Lord and father, there is none of all your ſonnes that ought more to deſire the vengeaunce of the iniurie and death of our Lord and graundfather, then I that am the eldeſt. But I will (if it pleaſe you) that yée conſider in this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe, not only the beginning, but alſo the middle and
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:7118:230"/>
the end, to what perill wee may come héereafter, for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwhile little profite ſome things well begunne that come to an euill end.</p>
                     <p>Then me thinketh, that it is much more allowable for a man to abſteine him for to beginne thinges whereof the endes bee dangerous, and when of may come more euill men good: for any thing is not ſaid to be fortunate or hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie vntill the time that it come vnto a good end. I ſay not theſe thinges for anie euill meaning or cowardiſe: but only to the end that ye beginne not a thing, and ſpecially that thing that yee haue in your heart to put in practiſe, but that ye firſt be well counſelled. Ye knowe well that all Affricke and Europe bee ſubiectes vnto the Greekes. How be they furniſhed with knights, worthy, hardy, and rich right maruellous? Cortes, at this day the force and ſtrength of vs here, is not to be compared vnto them, in force, nor in valiance. Wherefore, if we begin the warre againſt them, wee might lightly come to a miſchieuous and ſhamefull end. We that bee in ſo great reſt and eaſe amongſt our ſelues, what ſhall we ſeeke for to trouble our proſperitie, and welfare? Exione is not of ſo high priſe, that it behooueth all vs to put vs in perill and danger of death for her: ſhe hath been now long time there, where ſhe is yet. It were better that ſhee ſpend forth her time, that I thinke hath but litle time to liue, then we ſhoulde put vs all in ſuch perils. And meekly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I beſeech you, not to ſuppoſe in any wiſe, that I ſay theſe things for cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe: But I doubt the chaunces of fortune, and leaſt that vnder the ſhadowe of this thing ſhe confound and deſtroie your great ſeignorie, and leaſt that wee ſhould beginne thinges that we ought to leaue, for to eſchew more great miſchiefe, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>When Hector had made an end of his anſwere, Paris was nothing well content therewith: he ſtoode vppon his feete, and ſaide in this wiſe. My right déere Lord; I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you to heare me ſay, to what end ye may come, if
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:7118:231"/>
ye begin the warre againſt the Greeks. How, be not we garniſhed with ſo mighty and noble chiualrie as they be? Certes that be wee, which in all the world is none that may diſcomfit: and therefore begin ye hardly that enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe that ye haue thought of, and ſend ſome of your ſhips and of your people to runne into Gréece, and to take their people, and dammage the countrey. And if it pleaſe you to ſend me, I will do it with a good will and heart, for I am perſuaded, that if ye ſend me, I will doe great dammage vnto the Greekes, and I will take ſome noble ladie of Greece, and bring her with mee into this realme, and by commutation of her, you may recouer your ſiſter Exione. And if yee will vnderſtand and know, how I am perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of this thing, I will ſay to you, that the gods haue promiſed it to me. It happened of late (ſayd Paris) in the time that by your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement I was in the leſſer India, at the beginning of the Summer, that vpon a Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, I went to hunt in a forreſt very early, and that mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning I found nothing that turned mee to any pleaſure: and then after midday I found a great Hart. that I put to the chaſe ſo ſwiftly, that I left all my company behinde, and followed the Hart into the moſt deſert place of all the Forreſt, which forreſt was named Ida. And ſo long I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him, that I came vnto a place that was paſſing ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure and darke: and then I ſaw no more the Hart that I chaſed. I felt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> my ſelffore wearie, &amp; my horſe alſo that might no further go, he ſwet ſo on all ſides. So I lighted downe to the ground, and tied my horſe to a tree, and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me downe vpon the graſſe, and put vnder my head my Bowe bent, in ſted of a pillowe and anon I fell aſléepe. Then came to me in a viſion the god Mercurie, and in his company thrée goddeſſes, that is to witte, Venus, Pallas, and Iuno. He leſt the goddeſſes a little from me, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he approched, and ſayd vnto me in this maner: Paris, I haue brought here theſe thrée goddeſſes vnto thee, for a great ſtrife, or controuerſie that is fallen betwéene them.
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:7118:231"/>
They haue all choſen thee to be iudge, and to determine after thy will. Their controuerſie or ſtrife is ſuch, that as they did eate the other day together in a place, ſuddenly was caſt among them an apple of ſo marueilous forme of faireneſſe and beautie, that neuer was ſéene none ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore amongſt them. And there was written about this foreſayd apple in Gréekiſh language, Be it giuen to the faireſt. And ſo anon each of them would haue it, for any thing in the world, ſaying ech her ſelfe to be moſt faire, and fairer then the other, and ſo they might not agree. Wherefore they haue put it to thy iudgement, and ech of them promiſeth thee certeinly a gift for thy reward, that thou ſhalt haue without faile for the iudgement of the apple. If thou iudge that Iuno be the faireſt, ſhee ſhall make thée the moſt noble man in the world in magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence. If thou iudge for Pallas, ſhe ſhall make thee the moſt wiſeſt man of all the world in all ſciences. If thou iudge that Venus be the faireſt, ſhee ſhall giue vnto thee the moſt noble lady of Gréece. When I heard Mercurius thus ſpeake to me, I ſayd vnto him, that I could not giue true iudgement, vnleſſe I ſaw them all naked before me, for to ſee the faſhions of their bodies the better, and ſo for to giue a true iudgement. And then incontinent Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius did cauſe them to vnclothe themſelues all naked: and then I beheld them long, and me thought all thrée paſſing faire: but yet me ſéemed that Venus excéeded the beautie of the other: and therefore I iudged that the apple apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined to her. And then Venus greatly reioycing at my iudgement, confirmed vnto me the promiſe that Mercurie had made before in the fauour of her: and after I awoke ſtraight way. Wéene ye then, my right deare father, that the gods faile of any thing that they promiſe? Nay veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. So then I ſay to you ſtill, it is beſt that ye ſend me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Gréece, and that you may haue ioy of that I ſhall doe there. &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>After Paris, ſpake Deiphebus in this maner: My
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:7118:232"/>
right deare Lord, if in all the works that men ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne, they ſhould be aduiſed euer in the particularities and ſingular things that might happen or fal, they ſhould neuer enterpriſe nor do valiant act by hardineſſe. If the labourers ſhould leaue to eare and ſowe the land, for the ſeed that the birdes picke vp and gather, they ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer labour. And therefore (right deare father) let vs make ready for to ſend into Gréece of your ſhippes. Yée may not beléeue better counſell then that counſell that Paris hath giuen to you: for if he bring any noble ladie, ye may eaſily, for to yeeld her againe, haue againe your ſiſter Exione, for whome wee all ſuffer ſhame enough. After this ſpake Helenus, the fourth ſonne of king Pria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, that ſayd thus: Ha, ha, right puiſſant king, and right ſouereigne dominatour ouer vs your humble ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, and obedient ſonnes. Beware that couetouſneſſe of vengeance put not in you ſuch danger as lieth herein. Ye know very well, howe I vnderſtand and can the ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to knowe the things future and to come, as yee haue proued many times without finding fault: the gods for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidde, that it euer come that Paris be ſent into Gréece. For know ye for certaine, that if he goe to make any aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault, ye ſhall ſée this noble and honourable citie deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Gréekes, the Troyans ſlaine, and we all that be your children. And therefore diſſwade your ſelfe from theſe things, whereof the end ſhall be ſorrowe and great deſolation with right bitter death, the which you your ſelfe, and your wife, and we, we, that be your ſonnes may not eſcape. For truely if Paris go into Gréece, all theſe euils ſhall come thereof.</p>
                     <p>When the king heard Helenus thus ſpeake, hee was all abaſhed, and began to counterpoyſe and thinke of the matter, and helde his peace, and ſpake not of a great while: and ſo did all the other. Then aroſe vppe on his féete, Troylus the yoongeſt ſonne of king Priamus, and beganne to ſpeake in this manner. O noble men and
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:7118:232"/>
hardy, how be ye abaſhed for the wordes of this coward prieſt here? Is it not the cuſtome of Prieſtes for to dread the battailes by puſillanimitie, and for to loue good chéere and pleaſures, &amp; to fill their bellies with good wines and with good meats? who is he that beléeueth that any man may know the things to come, vnleſſe the gods do ſhew it him by reuelation? It is but follie for to tarie vpon this, or to beléeue ſuch things. If Helenus be afrayd, let him go into the Temple, and ſing the diuine Seruice, and let the other take reuenge of their iniuries by ſtrength and force of armes. O right deare father and lord, wherefore art thou ſo troubled for theſe wordes? ſend thy ſhippes into Gréece, and thy knights wiſe and hardie, that may make requitall to the Gréekes for their iniuries that they haue done vnto vs. All they that heard Troylus thus ſpeake, allowed him, ſaying, that hee had very well ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. And thus they finiſhed their parlement, and went to dinner.</p>
                     <p>After dinner the king Priamus called Paris and Deiphebus, and commaunded them expreſly, that they ſhould goe into the parties of Pannonie, haſtily to fetch and aſſemble knightes wiſe and hardie, for to take with them to Gréece. And then that ſame day Paris and Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phebus departed from the citie of Troy, for to performe and accompliſh the will of their father. The day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the king aſſembled to counſel al the citizens of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Troy, and ſayd vnto them after this maner: O my louing friendes and true citizens, ye all doe know notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, howe the Gréeks by their pride and inſolencie haue done to vs great wrongs, and innumerable dammages, as it is very well knowen in the al whole world. And ye know alſo, how they holde Exione my ſiſter in ſeruitude, wherefore I liue in great ſorrow: and alſo ye be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, howe I ſent Anthenor into Gréece, that hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing done: wherefore my ſorrowe is doubled. And for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as by yron hee cured the woundes inſanable,
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:7118:233"/>
I haue purpoſed to ſende Paris my ſonne with men of armes and puiſſance into Gréece, for to inuade and aſſaile our enemies by ſtrength, and for to do them great dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and for to aſſay if they might take any noble ladie of Gréece, and to ſend her into the city: and that by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation of her, I might get againe my ſiſter Exione. And forſomuch as I will not begin this thing, but that it may come to your knowledge firſt, I pray you that you ſay to mee your aduiſe: for without you I will not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céed further therein, foraſmuch as it toucheth you all as well as me.</p>
                     <p>When the king had thus finiſhed his ſpéeches, and that ech man held himſelfe ſilent a great while, then ſtood vp a knight named Pantheus, that was the ſonne of Deu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrobe the Phyloſopher, and ſayde: O right noble king, as I am your true ſeruant and vaſſaile, I will declare to you my aduice in this matter alſo, truely as a vaſſaile and ſubiect is bound to counſell his lord. Ye haue had wel in knowledge Deuphrobe the great Phyloſopher my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that liued whole and ſounde more then nine ſcore and tenne yeres, and was ſo wiſe in Phyloſophy, that he knew the ſcience of things to come hereafter: he ſayd vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me many times, and affirmed for trueth, that if Paris your ſonne went into Gréece, for to take any noble ladie by violence, that this noble citie ſhould be deſtroyed and burnt vnto aſhes by the Gréeks, and that ye and all yours ſhould be ſlaine cruelly. And therfore, right ſage and wiſe king, pleaſeth if your nobleneſſe to heare my wordes, and beléeue that the wiſe men haue ſayd, and be perſwaded in that thing that ye may not looſe by if ye leaue it, &amp; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of great ſorrowes may enſue, if ye perſeuere in opinion. Wherefore wil ye ſéeke to intrap the good eſtates of your reſt, and put your tranquillitie vnder the dangerous ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentures of fortune? Leaue this, and diſſwade your ſelfe, if it pleaſe you, from this folly, and finiſh and end your life in reſt happily, and ſuffer not Paris to goe into
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:7118:233"/>
Gréece in Armes. And if ye will algaſe, ſend ye another then Paris.</p>
                     <p>At theſe wordes of Pantheus grewe and aroſe great murmuring of the hearers. Some reprooued the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies of Deuphrobe the Philoſopher, and ſome helde it for mockerie and a fable: and they were of the greateſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, inſomuch that by the conſent of the more part, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris was appointed for to go into Gréece with men of armes: and the parliament finiſhed, each man went home into his houſe, and to his place.</p>
                     <p>When this concluſion was known of Caſſandra daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of king Priamus, ſhe began to make ſo great ſorrow, as if ſhe had been fooliſh or out of her right mind, &amp; began to cry on high, ſaying: Ha, ha, right noble Citie of Troy, what Faierie hath mooued thee to bee brought to ſuch pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rils, for which thou ſhalt in ſhort times be beaten downe, and thy high Towers be ouerthrown &amp; deſtroied vnto the ground? Ha, ha, queene Hecuba, for what ſinne haſt thou deſerued the death of thy children, which ſhalbe cruell and horrible wherefore with holdeſt not thou Paris from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into Gréece? which ſhalbe cauſe of this euill aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? And when ſhe had ſo cried, ſhe went vnto her father the king, and with weeping drowned in teares, praied him that he woulde be perſwaded for to leaue off his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe, ſaying: that ſhe wiſt by her ſcience the great euils and harmes that were comming by this meane. But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the diſſwaſions of Hector, neither admonition nor warning of Caſſandra, the king woulde not change his purpoſe, nor for Helenus his ſon, nor Pantheus, &amp;c.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>T the entry of the moneth of May, when the earth is attyred and adorned with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers ſloures, Paris and Deiphebus retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from Panonie, and brought with them thrée thouſand knightes right hardy and wiſe. Then they made readie two and twentie great ſhippes, and charged and laide in them all that was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient for them. Then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king Priamus called Eneas, Anthenor, and Polidamas that was the ſonne of Anthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, and praied them and commaunded, that they ſhoulde go into Greece with Paris and Deyphebus: and they offered themſelues to go with a good will. And when they were all ready and aſſembled for to go into their ſhippes, the king Priamus ſpake to them in this maner. It needeth not to vſe many wordes, for yee knowe well enough, for what cauſe I ſend you into Greece, and howe well that I haue cauſe for to auenge mee of the wronges that the Greekes haue done vnto vs, But the principall cauſe is, to recouer my ſiſter Exione, that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth in ſo great thraldome. And for to doe ſo yee ought to employ you: wherefore I pray you, and admoniſh you, that ye bend all your endeuour and diligence that I may recouer my ſiſter. And be ye certaine, if ye haue want of neede or ſuccour, I will ſuccour you with ſo great a ſtrength, that the Greekes ſhal not be able to beare. And I will that in this voiage ye hold Paris my ſonne Duke and conductor of this battaile of Eneas and Anthenor.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="455" facs="tcp:7118:234"/>After theſe wordes, Paris and all the other tooke leaue of the king, and entered into their ſhippes, and hoyſed vp ſailes, and recommended them to the guiding of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter and Venus, and ſailed ſo farre by the deepe Sea, that they arriuing in the partes of Greece, in coaſting the countrey, it happened them on a daie, that they mette a ſhippe, in the which was one of the greateſt kinges of Greece, named Menelaus, that went vnto the Citie of Epyre, vnto the duke Neſtor that had ſent for him. This Menelaus was brother of Agame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>non, and was married vnto the quéene Helene, that was the faireſt Ladie in the world, that men knew of in her time: and ſhe was ſiſter of king Caſtor, and Pollux, that dwelled then togither in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> citie of Sameſtare, and nouriſhing with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Hermione their néece daughter of the ſaid Helene, Menelaus made a little croſſe his ſhippe, and to turne out of the right way: and ſo the one did not knowe the other. And the Troyans ſailed ſo farre, that they arriued at the Iſle of Cithar in Gréece, and there they ancred their ſhippes and went a land. In this Ile was a temple of Venus paſſing auncient, and of great beautie, full of all richeſſe: for the inhabitantes alſo of the countrey had their deuotion ſpecially vnto Venus the Goddeſſe, and kept and ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized her feaſtes each yeare, and ſhée gaue to them aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweres of their demaundes. Then when the Troyans were arriued, they hallowed the moſt principall feaſt of Venus: and for this cauſe were there aſſembled men and women of the countrey there about, that made great cheere, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>When Paris knew this feaſt, he tooke his beſt clothes and did them on, alſo the beſt faring and cleanlieſt men that he hadde, and he went into the temple, and entered therin by faire and pleaſaunt maner, and made his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and offering of golde and ſiluer with great libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie.</p>
                     <p>Then was Paris much beholden on all ſides of them y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                        <pb n="456" facs="tcp:7118:235"/>
were there, for his beautie a for hee was one of the fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt knightes of the worlde, and was ſo richly and ſo queintly clothed and docked, that it gaue great pleaſure vnto all them that behelde him, and euery man deſired to know what he was, and whence hee came. And they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded of the Troyans, that told them, that it was Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, ſonne of king Priamus of Troy, that was come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Greece, by the commaundement of his father, for to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire amiably that they woulde render and yéeld againe Exione his ſiſter, that they had giuen to king Thelamon. So farre went the tidinges of the comming of theſe Troyans, and of their beautie and riche clothing, that the queene Helene heard ſpeake thereof: and then alter the cuſtome of women, ſhe had great deſire to know by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, if it were trueth that ſhe heard ſpeake of: and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed her to go vnto the temple vnder the colour of deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for to accompliſh her deſire. O howe great folly is it, vnto honeſt women to will go oftentimes vnto the feaſtes and ſportes of yong people, that little or nothing doe there, but muſe and deuiſe howe they may come to their deſire, and care not what miſchiefe may followe in body and in ſoule? The ſhip ſhould neuer periſh, if it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode alway in the porte, and were not ſent out into pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rils of the Sea.</p>
                     <p>It is a good thing and a pretious iewell, to haue a good woman that holdeth her honeſtly in her houſe. O howe great damage came vnto the Greekes and to the Troy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of this Citie, that Helene went ſo lightly to ſee the Troyans: that ought not ſo to doe, and ſpecially in the abſence of her huſband? But as it is the cuſtome of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to bee wilfull to bring their deſire to the end, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lene incontinent did make readie horſe and all that was conuenient, for to go vnto the temple: and ſhe did them to vnderſtand, that ſhée went for deuotion: for this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was not farre from the place where ſhee dwelled. When all was readie, and ſhee clothed in habite royall,
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:7118:235"/>
ſhe rode with her company vnto the Iſle of Cythar, and entered into a veſſell that brought her nigh to the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, where ſhee was receiued with great worſhip of them of the countrey, as their Ladie. Shee entered into the Temple right ſtately, and made there her deuotions and her oblations with right great liberalitie, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>When Paris knewe that the queene Helene, that was wife of king Menelaus, one of the moſt noble kings of Greece, was come vnto this temple, hée arraied him in the moſt gentlemanlieſt wiſe that hee coulde (and his company) and went into the temple, for he had long time before heard ſpeake of her great brauery. And then, as hée was come and ſawe her, hee was greatly ſurpriſed with her loue, and beganne earneſtly to beholde her, and to deſire to ſée the faſhion of her body, that was ſo faire and well ſhapen in all thinges, and in ſuch wiſe, that it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med properly to them that ſawe her, that nature hadde made her to be beholden and ſéen: for in her was nothing, but that it ſerued to manifeſt all the beautie that might be found in a woman. Wherefore Paris might not forbeare to beholde her, ſaying in himſelfe, that he hadde neuer ſéene, nor heard tell of any ſo faire and ſo well for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. And as hee beheld her, in likewiſe ſhee beheld him, as many times and oft, and her ſeemed that he was more fairer a great deale then hadde béen reported to her: and ſtill ſhe ſaide in her ſelfe, that ſhee neuer ſawe man of ſo great beautie, nor that pleaſed her ſo well to beholde: and ſo ſhe left all her deuotion and all other thoughts, and gaue no héede, nor reſpect to any thing, ſaue onely for to beholde Paris.</p>
                     <p>When Paris knewe and ſawe this, hee had great ioy, and beheld her ſweetly more and more, and ſhe him. By which ſight they ſhewed enough of their deſires, the one to the other: and thought diuerſe times, by what occaſion they might ſpeake togither. And ſo long they beheld each other, that by likelihoode, Helene made a token or
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:7118:236"/>
ſigne to Paris, that hée approched to her, and anon Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris ſate downe beſide her, whiles that the people plaied in the temple, and ſpake vnto her with a ſoft voice right ſweetly, and ſhee to him, and declared each to other how they were ſurpriſed with the loue of the one and of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and reaſoned how they might come to the end of their deſire. And when they had ſpoken enough of their hote l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>e, Paris tooke leaue of her, and iſſued out of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, hee and his companie: and Helene ſent after him her eyes as farre as the might.</p>
                     <p>When Paris was come to his ſhippe, he called to him the moſt noble and greateſt of his companie, and ſaide to him in this maner. My friendes, yee knowe well where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the king my father hath ſent vs vnto Greece: that is to wit, for to recouer Exione his ſiſter: and if we may not recouer her, that we ſhould doe damage vnto the Gréeks. We may not recouer Exione, for ſhee is in ouer ſtrong an hand: and alſo it ſhoulde bée to our great daunger and damage, ſince it is ſo that the king Thelamon, that hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth her and loueth her heartily, is more puiſſant then we, and is in his owne proper heritage. Wée be nothing ſo puiſſant for to take in Greece any noble Citie, the countrey is ſo full of people, and of manie valiant folke. Then mée ſéemeth good, that the faire gift and notable that the Gods haue ſent vnto vs, we refuſe not. Wée ſée in this Ile come to that feaſt the moſt greateſt citizens, and the temple repleniſhed with the moſt noble women of this prouince, and alſo the queene Helene, that is la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of this countrey and wife of king Menelaus. This temple is alſo full of all riches: if wee might take them aliue that bée in the Temple, and bring them priſoners with vs, and take the Gods that there bee of golde and of ſiluer, wée ſhall haue conquered a great gaine, and ſo may get other riches that wee may go fetch in ſome other places.</p>
                     <p>If ye thinke good, I am of the opinion, that now this
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:7118:236"/>
night wée will enter into the temple all armed, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ée will take men and women, and all that we ſhall find and bring into our ſhippes, and principally Helene: for if wée may bring her into Troy, the king Priamus may lightly enough haue againe his ſiſter Exione for her: therefore aduiſe you ſpeedily what is beſt to bee done, whiles the matter is hot, and before they eſcape vs. Some of them blamed this thing, and ſome allowed it: and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, they concluded after manie councels, that they would doe as Paris had deuiſed.</p>
                     <p>Now it hapned that when the night was come, &amp; the Moone was nigh gone downe, the Troyans armed them in the moſt ſecret wiſe that they coulde, and left ſome of them for to keepe their ſhippes, and the other went pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uily vnto the Temple, and entered therein, ſo armed as they were, and with little defence, tooke all them that they found in the temple, and all the riches that were therein. And Paris with his owne hand tooke Helene, and them of her companie, and brought into their ſhips all the beſt, and put them in ſure guard, and after retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the bootie. Then beganne the noyſe paſſing great within the temple, of the priſoners, and of ſome that had leauer ſuffer to be ſlaine then for to bee taken priſoners. The noiſe was heard farre, in ſuche wiſe that they of the caſtle that ſtoode thereby heard it: and incontinent they aroſe and armed them, and came to aſſaile the Troyans, as valiaunt as they were. Then beganne the ſkirmiſh right fierſe and mortall: but the Troyans (that were foure againſt one, ſlew manie of them, and the other fled and retired into their caſtle: and then the Troyans tooke as much as they coulde finde of goodes, and bare it vnto their ſhippes, and entered into them, and hoiſed vp their ſailes, and ſailed ſo long, that on the 7. day they came and ariued at the port of Troy, their ſhips ful of good priſoners and of good riches: and they abode at the port of Tenedon, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was but 3 mile fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Troy: and there were receiued with<pb n="460" facs="tcp:7118:237"/>
ioy. And then Paris ſent a proper meſſenger vnto his father the king Priamus to let him haue knowledge of his comming, and of all that that hee had done in Gréece. Of theſe tidings the king was greatly reioyſed, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded in all the Citie to make a feaſt ſolemnly for theſe tidinges, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Whiles that Helene was with the other priſoners in the ſhip of Paris, ſhée made great ſorrow, and ceaſſed not to wéepe nor to bewaile with great ſighes her huſband, her brethren, her daughter, her countrey and her friends, and was in ſo great ſorrow, that ſhe left to eat and drink. And Paris comforted her the moſt ſweetly that he coulde: but ſhee might not ſuffer to forbeare wéeping, and then Paris ſaid to her in this maner. How Lady: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore make ye this ſorrowe day and night without reſt? What man or woman is it, that might long endure and ſuffer this? Know not ye that this ſorrow hurteth your health? Yes verily lady, yée make too much thereof: Wherefore from henceforth, I pray you to leaue and take reſt, for in this realme yée ſhall lacke nothing, and no more ſhall thoſe priſoners that yée will haue recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended: and ye ſhalbe the moſt renowmed lady of this Realme and the moſt riche, and your meanie that bee héere ſhall want nothing. To theſe wordes aunſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Helene to Paris in this manner: I knowe well (ſaid thee) that will I, or I will not) I muſt needs do as yée will, ſince that I am your priſoner: and if any good bee done to me and to the priſoners, I hope the Gods ſhall thanke, and reward them that ſo doe. Ha, ha, ſaide Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, doubt you not, for mee, I will doe to you and them all that ſhall pleaſe you to commaund. And then he took her by the hand and brought her into a more ſecret place, and ſaide vnto her: Madame, thinke yee, foraſmuch as it hath pleaſed the Gods for to ſuffer you to bee brought by mée into this prouince and kingdome, that yée be loſt, and vndone, and that ye ſhall not bée more rich and
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:7118:237"/>
more honoured then ye haue béen, and that the Realme of Troy is not more riche, then the Realme of Achay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yes verily that it is. Thinke yee that I will maintaine you diſhoneſtly? certes nay, but will take you to my wife, and ſo ſhall ye be more honoured then ye haue béene with your huſband, and more praiſed: for your huſband is not iſſued out of ſo noble a houſe as I am, nor ſo valiant: nor he loued you neuer ſo well as I will doe. Therefore ceaſe yée from henceforth to make ſuch ſorrow, and beleeue me of this that I haue ſaid to you Ha, ha, ſaid ſhee, who can abſtaine her from making of ſorrowe being in the ſtate that I am in? alas, this caſe happened me neuer before: but ſince it muſt be none otherwiſe, ſore vexed and gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, I will doe that thing which ye require of me, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as I haue no abilitie to reſiſt it. Thus was Helene recomforted a little: and Paris did pleaſe her to the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of his power, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>When the morrow came, betime hee did cauſe to clothe her, and array her the moſt honourably that he might, and made her to ſit vpon a Palfrey richly arraied and dec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked: and ſo did hee other priſoners, each after his degree: and after hee went to horſe backe himſelfe, and Doyphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus his brother, Eneas, Anthenor, and Polydamus, with a great company of noble men, and accompanied the queene Helene, and departed from Tnedon, and went to Troy ward. And there came againſt them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the town the king Priamus with a great company of noble men, and receiued his children, and his friendes with great ioy: and after came to Helene, and bowed rightly ſwéetly to her, and did to her great ioy and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. And when they came nigh the citie, they ſound great ſtore of people glad of their comming with many ſortes of inſtrumentes of Muſicke: and in ſuch ioy came vnto the Pallace of king Priamus: and hee himſelfe lighted downe and holpe Helene downe from her palfrey, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And then when it came vnto the morrow, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris (by the agreement and conſent of his father) tooke Helene to his wife, and wedded her in the temple of Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace: and therefore the feaſt was lengthened throughout all the citie, and there was ioy that endured yet after eight dayes whole, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>When Caſſandra knew for trueth that Paris her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had wedded Helene, ſhe beganne to make great ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, to cry &amp; bray as a woman out of her wit, &amp; ſaid thus.</p>
                     <p>O vnhappy Troyans, wherefore reioyce yee of the wedding of Paris, whereof ſo many euils ſhall come and follow? And wherefore ſée not yee the death of your ſelues, and of your ſonnes that ſhal be ſlaine before your eyes and their huſbandes before their wiues with great ſorrow? Ha, ha, noble citie of Troy, how ſhalt thou bée deſtroied and put to nought? Ha, ha, vnhappy mothers, what ſorrow ſhall ye ſee, when yeé ſhall ſée your little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren taken and diſmembred before you? Ha ha Hecuba caitife and vnhappie, where ſhalt thou take the water y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou ſhalt wéep for the death of thy children. Ha, ha, people blinde and fooliſh, why ſend not yée incontinent Helene home againe, and yéeld her vnto her right huſband, before that the ſwordes of your enemies come, and flea you with great ſorrow? Wéene ye that this prince (the huſband of Helene) wil dwel at home without greeuous vengeance? Certes that ſhalbe your dolorous deſtruction and end. Ha ha, vnhappy Helene, thou ſhalt doe vs much ſorrow. As Caſſandra ſpake and cried thus with high voice, and with great ſorrow, the king Priamus knewe it, and did her to be taken priſoner, and ſent to her, and did pray her, that ſhe would ceaſſe, but ſhee would not. And then hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded, that ſhee ſhould bee faſt ſhut in priſon, and in yrons, where ſhée was kept many daies. O what pitie was it, that the Troyans beleeued not this warning and admonition? For if they had beleeued it, they hadde

And how Caſtor and Pollux brethren of her, purſued Paris in the ſea: and of their death: and of the condition and maner of the Lordes, as well Greekes as Troyans.</head>
                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S theſe thinges were done, as is ſaide, Menelaus (that ſoiourned at Epyre with the Duke Neſtor) heard tell the trueth of the priſe and taking of his wife, and of his people, whereat he was ſore angry, and much abaſhed, and was ſo greeeued and ſorrowfull, that he fell to the ground in a ſownd. And then when he was come to himſelfe againe, hee beganne ſore to complaine him, and make the greateſt ſorrowe of the world. And aboue all other thinges he was moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie for his wife, and bewailed her beautie, and her ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, and might by no way bee comforted. When the duke Neſtor heard ſay thereof, hee came to him haſtily, and comforted him the moſt beſt wiſe he could, for hee lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him with great loue. But Menelaus could not leaue his ſorrow: but tooke his way vnto his countrey, and the duke Neſtor brought him on his way with a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pane of noble men.</p>
                     <p>He ſent vnto the king Agamemnon his brother that he ſhoulde come and ſpeake with him. And alſo he ſent vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Caſtor &amp; Pollux, the brothers of Helene, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſhuld come alſo to him. And anon, as they had heard the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, they came vnto him. When Agamenon ſawe his
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:7118:239"/>
brother make ſuch ſorrow and heauineſſe, he ſaid to him, ah my brother, wherefore haſt thou ſuch ſorrow? ſuppoſe that the cauſe be iuſt, yet a wiſe man ought not to ſhew ſuch ſemblance outward: it cauſeth his friendes to be ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull, and his enemies to bee ioyous. And therefore, faine thy ſorrow and alay thy rage, and make ſemblance as though thou regardeſt nothing this that is befallen: for by weeping nor by vſing of ſorrowe, thou maieſt neuer come to honour nor vengeance, but onely by the force of the naked ſword: thou ſhalt therfore awake thy courage, and ſo ſhalt thou take reuenge of the harmes that bée done to thee. Thou knoweſt what puiſſance we haue, and what helpers and ayders we ſhall finde for to auenge vs: for this iniury toucheth all the kinges and princes of Greece, and aſſoone as wee ſhall require them of helpe, there ſhall not be one but hee will helpe vs with all his power, and then wee will go with great puiſſance before Troy, and will ſlea our enemies, and doe what wee liſt, and wil deſtroy the Citie. And if it happen that we may take Paris, that is actor of theſe hurtes and illes, we wil hang him, and make him die an euill death. Ceaſe then thy ſorrow, and let vs make to be knowne to al the kings and princes of Greece this iniury, and require them that they will helpe for to take vengeance. Then was Mene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus recomforted with the wordes of his brother, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non they ſent their letters vnto all the barons of Greece: and at their ſending they came all, firſt Achilles, Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clus, Diomedes, and many other. And aſſoone as they knew wherefore they were ſent for, they ſaid, that they would go to Troy with all their ſtrength, for to auenge this ſhame, and recouer Helene. So they choſe them A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gemenon chiefe and Prince of their hoſte, as he that was wiſe and prudent, and of good councell.</p>
                     <p>Nowe it happened that the king Caſtor and the king Pollux that were brethren of the Queene Helene, as ſoon as they heard ſay, that their ſiſter was rauiſhed, they
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:7118:239"/>
entred into their ſhippes, and went after the Troyans with a great company of men of armes, for to ſee if they might recouer her. On the third day that they were on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſea, there roſe ſo great a tempeſt in the ſea, &amp; therewith came ſo great a raine, and thunder, that their ſhips were caſt by the waues, one here, another there, the maſts bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, their ſailes rent, and finally they were all periſhed and drowned, that neuer was none ſéene of them. And the Paynims ſay, that theſe two brethren were tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the gods, into the heauen or zodiaque, and retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into the ſigne of two beaſtes, foraſmuch as they were brethren germaines. And thus ended their liues, by the occaſion of the taking of their ſiſter. Some Poets faine, that theſe brethren be tranſlated into two ſtarres, that is, the North ſtarre, and the South ſtarre, which be named after them Caſtor and Pollux.</p>
                     <p>In this place declareth Dares, in his booke, the faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Gréekes that were before Troy, of the moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table of them, as hee that ſaw them and beheld them ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times during the truce that was often times betwéene both parties, during the ſiege before the citie. And he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſpeake of Helen, and ſayeth, that ſhe was ſo faire, that in the worlde no man could finde no fairer woman, nor better formed of all members. Agame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>non was long and white of body, ſtrong of members, and well formed, louing labour, diſcréet, hardie, and paſſing well beſpoken. Menelaus was of meane ſtature, hardie in armes, and couragious. Achilles was of right great beautie, blonke haires and criſpe, gray eyes and great, of amiable ſight, large breaſts, &amp; broad ſhoulders, great armes, his reines high enough, an high man of great ſtature, and had no e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall nor like to him among all the Greekes, deſirous to fight, large in gifts, and outragious in ſpending. Tanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus was great of body, and right ſtrong, faithful, humble, flying quarrels if they were not iuſt and true. Aiax was of great ſtature, great and large in the ſhoulders, great
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:7118:240"/>
armes, and alway was well clothed, and very richly: and was of no great enterpriſe, and ſpake very quicke. The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamon Aiax was a marueilous faire knight, hee hadde blacke haires, and had great pleaſure in ſong, and he ſang himſelfe very well: he was of great proweſſe, and a good man of warre, and without pompe. Vliſſes was the moſt faire man amongſt all the Gréekes, but was verie deceitfull and ſubtill, and deliuered his ſpéeches ioyfully: he was a very great lier, and was ſo well beſpoken, that he had no fellow nor any like vnto him. Diomedes was great, and had a broad breaſt, and marueilous ſtrong, of a fierce regard and fight, falſe in his promiſes, woorthie in armes, deſirous of victorie, dread and redoubted: for he was greatly iniurious to his ſeruants, and luxurious, wherefore hee ſuffered many paines. The Duke Neſtor was of great members and long, and well beſpoken, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>créete and very thriftie, and gaue alwayes good counſell, quickly and ſoone hee would be very angry, and ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way pleaſed againe: hee was the moſt true friend in the world. Protheſilaus was faire, and of goodly ſtature, right noble and actiue in armes. Neoptolemus was great, blacke haire and great eyes, but ioyous and well chéered, his eiebrowes ſmooth, ſtammering in his words, but he was wiſe in the lawe. Palamedes ſonne of king Naulus, was of right faire ſhape and leane, ſtout and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable, a good man &amp; liberall. Polydarius, was paſſing great, fatte and ſwollen, hardie, high minded, and proud, without trueth. Mathaon was of meane ſtature, proud and hardy, and one that little ſlept by night. Briſayda, daughter of Calcas, was paſſing faire, of meane ſtature, white and medled with redde, and well made, ſweet and pitifull, and whom many men loued for her beautie: for the loue of her came the king of Perſia into the ayd of the Gréeks, vnto the ſiege before Troy.</p>
                     <p>Of them that were within Troy, the ſame Dares ſayth, firſt of king Priamus, that he was long, griſly and
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:7118:240"/>
faire, and had a lowe voice, right hardie, and that he did gladly eate earely in the morning, a man without dread, and that hated flatterie: hee was vpright, and a good iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticer, and had great delight to heare ſinging and ſoundes of muſike, and earneſtly loued his ſeruants, and much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched them. Of all his ſonnes, there was none ſo hardy as was Hector, the eldeſt ſonne of king Priamus. This was he that paſſed in his time all other knights in puiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance, and ſtuttered a little: hee was great, and had hard members, and coulde endure much paine, and was much hairie, curled, and liſped: there neuer iſſued out of Troy ſo ſtrong a man, nor ſo worthy: nor neuer came there a villanous word out of his mouth: he was neuer wearie of fighting in battell: there was neuer knight better beloued of his people, then hee was. Paris was a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing faire knight, and ſtrong, ſoft haired, and true, ſwift, and ſweete of ſpeech tutmouthed, well drawing a bowe, wiſe and hardie in battaile, very reſolute, and couetous of lordſhippe. Deiphebus and Helenus were both paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing like of faſhion, in ſuch wiſe that a man coulde not verie well know the one from the other, and alſo they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled paſſing well the king Priamus their Father. Deiphebus was very wiſe and hardie in armes. And Helenus was a marueilous wiſe Clerke. Troylus was great and of ſtout courage, well manered, and well belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of yoong maidens: in ſtrength and merineſſe hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled and was much like vnto Hector, and was the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond after him in proweſſe: and there was not in all the whole realme a more ſtrong nor more hardy yoong man. Eneas had a great body: hee was marueilouſlie diſcreet in his workes, well beſpoken and verie courteous in his words, full of good counſell, and of ſkilfull cunning. He had his viſage ioyous, and the eyes cleere and gray, and was the richeſt man of Troy, next the king Pria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, in townes and caſtles. Anthenor was long and leane, and ſpake much, but he was diſcreet, and of great
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:7118:241"/>
induſtrie, and one whom the king Priamus loued great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and that gladly played among his company, and was a right wiſe man. Polydamas his ſonne was a goodlie yoong man and a faire, hardy, and of good maners, long and leane like his father, browne, and was ſtrong in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſſance of armes, and of good and courteous words. The king Menon was great, and a goodly knight, he had large ſhoulders, and great armes, he was hard in the breſt, and of great proweſſe, and one that brought many knightes vnto Troy. The queene Hecuba was a ſtrong big wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and ſéemed better a man then a woman: ſhee was a noble woman, paſſing wiſe, courteous and honeſt, and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the works of charitie. Andromache the wife of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, was a paſſing faire woman, and white, and that had faire eyes, and faire haire: ſhe was among all other women right honeſt and ciuill in her works. Caſſandra was of a faire ſtature, and cléere, round mouthed, wiſe, of ſhining eies, ſhe loued virginitie, &amp; knew much of things to come, by Aſtronomie &amp; other ſciences. Polixena was a very faire daughter, and tender, and was the very ray of beautie, in whom nature failed nothing, ſaue onely that ſhe made her mortall: and ſhe was the faireſt mayde that was in her time, and the beſt formed. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mo were within the towne and without, during the fiege: but theſe were the principall &amp; greateſt of name. And therfore Dares declareth the faſhion of them, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſeth not of the other.</p>

In this temple was a great Image, compoſed and made all of fine golde in the worſhip of God Apollo.

                     <p>Vpon this part the authour declareth, from whence came firſt Idolatry. We finde in <hi>Hiſtoria eccleſiaſtica,</hi> that when Herod was deceiued by the three kinges that retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not againe to him, but worſhipped our Lord Ieſus Chriſt as is contained in the Goſpel, and afterward de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted by another way, &amp;c. that Herodes purpoſed to haue ſlaine the childe Ieſus, and therefore the glorious Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins our Lady Saint Mary his mother, and Ioſeph bare him to Egypt. And as ſoone as our Ladie entered into Egypt, all the Idolles of Egypt fell downe to the earth all to be broken and bruiſed, according to the propheſie of Eſay that ſaid thus. <hi>Aſcendet dominus in nubem leuem, &amp; ingredietur Egyptum, &amp; mouebuntur ſimulacra Egypte.</hi> Shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that at the comming of our ſauiour Ieſus Chriſt, all Idolatry ſhould haue an end. And among the Iewes, Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael was the firſt that made an Idol, and that was of earth.</p>
                     <p>And Promotheus made the firſt among the Paynims, and taught other the maner howe to make them: but the right beginning of Idolatry came of Belus king of Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, that was father of king Ninus, the which Belus when hee was dead, his ſonne Ninus did burie him in a rich ſepulture, and did make an Image of fine golde, to

the ſemblaunce and likeneſſe of his father, for to haue conſolation and memorie of him, and worſhipped him as his god, and compelled his folke to worſhip him: and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>none an euill ſpirite entred within the Image, and gaue to the people anſwers of their demaundes. And thus by the example of him, the painims made other, in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of their friends, and worſhipped them: and thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céeded they in Idolatry, and there were none but that they had their proper gods that gaue to them their aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere of their demaundes, by the deuiſe of the ennemy, that ſo deceiued them, and brought to damnation by the enuy that hée had, and yet hath vppon the ligne of men, that God made to fulfill the places of Paradiſe, from whence hée was caſt out for his pride into this horrour and darkeneſſe, and after the daye of Iudgement to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide in Hell for euermore, in the company of the damned men.</p>
                     <p>Whenas Achilles and Patroclus were arriued in the Iſle of Delphos, they went with great deuotion into the Temple of Apollo, and there made their oblations with great liberalitie, and demaunded of him aunſwere of their affaires and workes. Then aunſwered Apollo with a lowe voice. Achilles, returne vnto the Gréekes that haue ſent thée hither, and ſay vnto them, that it is to come, and ſhall happen for certainetie, that they ſhall goe ſafely to Troy, and there they ſhall make many bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels. But in the tenth yéere they ſhal haue victorie, and deſtroy the cittie, and they ſhall ſlay the king Priamus, his wife, and his children, and the moſt great of the countrey.

                     <p>Of this aforeſaide aunſwer was Achilles paſſing ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: And it chaunced whileſt they were yet in this Temple, that a Biſhoppe of Troy named Calchas ſonne of a man named Thiſtram which was a paſſing wiſe man entred into this Temple: and he was ſent al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo

                     <p>As he then had made his oblations, and demaundes for them of Troy, Apollo anſwered to him: Calchas, Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas, beware that thou returne not againe to Troy: but go thou with Achilles vnto the Greekes, and depart ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer from them, for the Greekes ſhall haue victorie of the Troyans, by the agreement of the Gods, and thou ſhalt be to them right neceſſarie in counſell, and in doctrine.

                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter this feaſt that the Greekes hadde made, for the good anſweres of Apollo, Calchas went in a morning in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Achilles and of Patroclus vnto the tent of Agamemnon, where all the moſt nobles of the hoſte were aſſembled, and he ſaluted them right courteouſly, ſaying: O noble kinges and princes, that be héere aſſembled for vengeance of the great iniuries to you done by the Troyans, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore tarry ye now here, after the Gods haue giuen their aunſwere? wéene yee not that the king Priamus hath his eſpies among you, and that whiles ye ſoiourne, hee furniſheth not his countrey and citie with vittaile, with horſes, and with other neceſſaries? Is not a great part of the Summer paſſed, and ye haue yet nothing enterpriſed vpon your enemies. Beware that ye be not vnkinde and ingrate, at the aunſwere of the Gods: and that by your negligence they change not their aunſwere into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. Therefore tary ye no longer, but ſhippe you and your horſe, and go ye to the ſea, and ceaſſe not vntill the time that the promiſes of the Gods be accompliſhed. And when Calchas had thus ſpoken, each man ſaide, that hée had well ſaide and ſpoken. And then Agamemnon ſent vnto all the hoſte, and commaunded with a trumpet, that euery man ſhoulde make him readie to remooue. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non they entered into their ſhippes, and diſancred, and drewe vp their ſailes, and went all vnto the Sea: and they hadde not long ſailed, not paſſing a mile from Athens, but the aire that was before verie cleere and
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:7118:245"/>
faire, beganne to waxe troublous and thicke, and there beganne a right great tempeſt in the ſea, of winde, of raine, and of thunder: inſomuch that there was none ſo hardie but he had feare, and we end to haue died, for their ſhippes were caſt by the ſea, the one here, and the other there, and they ſuppoſed none other for certaine, but to haue béen drowned. Then ſaid Calcas to them that were with him, that the cauſe of the tempeſt was foraſmuch as Diana their Goddeſſe was wroth and angry againſt them, becauſe they departed from Athens and made to her no ſacrifice: and, for to appeaſe this wrath, it behoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that the king Agamemnon ſacrifice to her with his owne hand Iphiginie his daughter a young virgine, and tender of age, and that otherwiſe the tempeſt ſhoulde neuer ceaſſe. And for to ſpeed this ſacrifice, hée counſelled to turne the nauy, and to apply it to the Ile of Andill, where the temple of the Goddeſſe Diana was, &amp;c. When the king Agamemnon vnderſtoode this thing, hée was all greeued and paſſing ſorrowfull in his minde, for he loued his daughter Iphigenie with great loue: and on the other ſide, hée was praied and required of all the other kinges and princes of Greece, that hee woulde make no delay to this that was ſo great a matter, or to withſtand the ſacrifice: wherefore hee was vanquiſhed by the ſaide Princes, and for the loue of his countrey, hee tooke his ſaide daughter Iphigenie, and in the preſence of great kinges and princes, ſacrificed her vnto the goddeſſe Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na: and anon the tempeſt ceaſſed, and the aire became neate and cléere, and the ſea well quieted and in tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie and peace. And then hee went againe into his ſhip, and all the other in like maner, drewe vppe their ſailes, and ſailed before the winde, ſo farre that they arriued at a port of the realme of Troy, nigh vnto a Caſtell called Sarrabana. Dares putteth not downe determinately, what was the cauſe wherfore King y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Agamemnon made his Sacrifice vnto Diana. But Ouid (in the twelfth
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:7118:246"/>
booke of Methamorphoſe) ſaith that it was Iphigenie his daughter, as aboue is ſaid. And when they of the caſtle ſawe the great Nauie at their porte, they armed them, and came vnto the porte, weening to defend their land againſt the Gréekes, and aſſailed them that then were come a land, that were yet weary of the trauaile of the Sea. But the Greekes iſſued anon out of their ſhippes in great plenty all armed, and ſlew them, and chaſed them vnto their Caſtle, and killed them with flying, and ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into the Caſtle with them, and there put them all to death, and tooke the booties, and after beate downe the caſtle vnto the earth, and then reentered into their ſhips againe, and ſailed ſo farre, that they arriued at the port of Tenedon, and there then they ancred their ſhips, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>At this port was a paſſing ſtrong Caſtle, well peopled and full of great riches, and was three mile from Troy. When they of the caſtle ſaw the Greekes, they ranne to armes, and furniſhed their caſtle with good fighters, and the other iſſued out and came vnto the porte, where they found the Greeks that were then iſſued out of their ſhips all armed, and great plentie, and took all that they could finde. Thus beganne the battaile betweene them right fierce and mortall, and there were enough ſlain &amp; dead of both partes: and manie mo of the Greekes then of the Troians. But as ſoone as the great ſtrength of the Greekes were landed, the Troyans might no longer ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer nor abide, but put them to flight, ſome to the caſtle, and the other fled vnto Troy. Then the Greekes beſtirred them and belaid the caſtle round about, and aſſailed it on both ſides, and they within defended it paſſing well vpon the walles, and ſlewe many by ſhotte and by Engines, but the Greekes dreſſed their engines all about the caſtle, and ſet their ladders vnto the walles, and went vpon all ſides, and they within defended them valiauntly, and made them fall down in their ditches, ſome dead and ſome hurt.

how ſtrong that the puiſſance bée) that it pleaſe the Gods that it be without pride and felonie: for it is ſo, that of the ſinne of pride grow all other vices, and that the gods reſiſt and withſtand the inſolent and proud people. And therefore we ought to put away pride from our workes: and in eſpeciall in this worke here now, and vſe the right way of iuſtice, to the end that no man may reprehend vs, nor blame.</p>
                     <p>Ye know well, that we be come thus farre, for to take vengeance of the iniuries and the wronges that the king Priamus hath done to vs: and we haue done to him now great hurt and damage. Ye may well know for trueth, that they haue aſſembled in the city of Troy great power, for to defend them againſt vs: and alſo the Citie is paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing great and ſtrong: and ye know well, that they be vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their proper heritage, that is a thing that doubleth their force and ſtrength. For ye may take example of the Crowe, that otherwhile defendeth well her neſt againſt the fawcon. I ſay not theſe thinges, for any doubt that I haue, but that we ſhall haue victorie, and that wee ſhall deſtroy their Citie, albeit that it is ſtrong: but onely for our worſhip, to the end that wee be recommended to haue conducted this worke by great diſcretion, and without pride: for oftentimes, by our too haſtie enterpriſe, a thing of great waight, without aduiſed councell may come to a miſchieuous end. Ye know well, that it is long ago that the king Priamus did require vs, by his ſpecial meſſengers, that we ſhoulde render to him his ſiſter Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one, &amp; that by our hautineſſe &amp; pride we would not deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer her againe: and if wee hadde deliuered and ſent her home againe, theſe euilles had neuer happned in the Ile of Cythar, as they now be. And the queene Helene, that is of the moſt noble of Gréece, had neuer been rauiſhed, nor lead away: and alſo we had not enterpriſed the paine nor the labour, where we nowe be in. And there is none of vs that knoweth what ſhal happen to him good or euil:

and therefore if ye ſeeme good, that we might returne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our countrey, without ſuffering of more paine, with our honour and worſhippe, wee will ſend vnto the king Priamus our ſpeciall meſſengers, and bidde him to ſend and deliuer againe to vs Helene fréely, and that he reſtore vnto vs the dammages that Paris hath done in the Ile of Cythare: for if he will ſo do, our returne ſhalbe honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and we may no more aſke of him by right. And if he refuſe this, wee ſhall haue two things that ſhall fight for vs, that is, iuſtice, and our true quarrell, and our puiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance excuſed: and when men ſhall heare of our offers, they will giue the wrong and blame to the Troyans, and to vs the laud and praiſe: and we ſhalbe excuſed of all the dammages that wee ſhall doe to them, after theſe offers. Therefore aduiſe you among your ſelues, what thing ye will doe.</p>
                     <p>Then were there ſome badde people, that blamed this counſell, and ſome allowed it: and finally, they concluded to do ſo as Agamemnon had ſayde. Then they choſe for their meſſengers, Diomedes and Vliſſes, for to goe to Troy, and make their legation: which tooke their horſes, and went incontinently thither, and came to Troy about midday, and they went ſtraight to the Pallace of king Priamus, and tooke their horſes to kéepe at the gate, and after went vp into the hall, and in going vp, they maruei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led greatly of the rich works that they ſaw in all the pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, and ſpecially of a tree that they ſawe in a plaine, the which was made by arte Mathematike, marueilouſly compoſed, and of great beautie, for the tronchon or ſtocke beneath, was no greater but of the greatneſſe of a ſpeare, and was paſſing long and high, and aboue had branches of golde and of ſiluer, and leaues that ſpread ouer the pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, and ſaue a little, it couered all: and the fruite of the ſame tree was of diuers precious ſtones, that gaue great light and brightnes, and alſo did much pleaſe and delight them that beheld it. They went ſo farre foorth that they

came into the great hall where the king Priamus was, accompanied with noble men. And then without ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the king nor the other, Vliſſes ſayd vnto him in this maner.</p>
                     <p>King Priamus, marueile nothing, that we haue not ſaluted thee, foraſmuch as thou art our moſt mortall ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie. The king Agamemnon (from whome wee be meſſengers) ſendeth and commaundeth thee by vs, that thou deliuer and ſend vnto him the queene Helen, whom thou haſt cauſed moſt vilely to bee rauiſhed and taken from her huſband, and that thou make ſatiſfaction for all the damages that Paris thy ſonne hath done in Gréece: and if thou ſo doe, I ſuppoſe thou ſhalt ſhew thy ſelfe a wiſe man: but if thou doe not, beholde what euils may come vnto thee and thine: for thou ſhalt die an euill death, and all thy men, and this noble and famous citie ſhall be deſtroyed. When the king Priamus heard Vliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes thus ſpeake, he anſwered incontinently (without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding or aſking any counſel:) I marueile greatly of theſe thy wordes, that requireſt of mee that thing that a man already vanquiſhed and ouercome, and one that might not defende himſelfe no more, with great paine would accord to thee. I beleeue not that the Greeks haue ſuch puiſſance to do that thing which thou haſt ſayd vnto me: they require of me amends, and I ought to demand the like of them Haue not they ſlaine my father and my brethren, and lead away my ſiſter in ſeruitude, whome they daigne not to marrie honourably, but to hold her and vſe her as a common woman? And for to haue her again, I haue ſent vnto them Anthenor, and woulde haue par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned them the ſurplus: but yee knowe the villanies and menaces that they did vſe towardes my meſſenger: and therefore I ought not to heare anything that yee ſay vnto mee: but had rather die valiantly, then to agree to your requeſt. And let Agamemnon knowe, that I deſire neuer to haue peace nor loue with the Greeks, that haue
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:7118:248"/>
done to me ſo many diſpleaſures. And if it were not that ye be meſſengers, I ſhoulde make you die an euill death. Therefore goe ye your way anon, for I may not beholde you without diſpleaſure in mine heart. Then beganne Diomedes to laugh for deſpight, and ſayde thus: Ha king, if without diſpleaſure thou mayeſt not ſee vs, that be but twaine, then wilt thou not be without diſpleaſure all the dayes of thy life: for thou ſhalt ſee from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foorth before thine eyes great armies of Gréekes, the which ſhall come before the citie, and ſhall not ceaſe for to aſſaile it continually: againſt whom thou mayeſt not long defend thee, but that thou and thine finally ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue bitter death. Therefore thou ſhouldeſt take better counſell in thy doings if thou wert well aduiſed.</p>
                     <p>Then were there many Troyans that would haue runne vppon the Gréekes, and drew their ſwordes for to haue ſlaine them. But the king Priamus forbade them, and ſayd vnto them, that they ſhould let two fooles vtter their follie: and that it was the nature of a foole to ſhew follie, and to a wiſe man to ſuffer it. Ha, ha, ſir, ſayd E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas, what is that, that yee ſay? men muſt ſhewe to a foole his fooliſhneſſe: and truely, if it were not in your preſence, this fellow that hath ſpoken ſo fooliſhly before you, ſhoulde receiue his death by mine owne hande. It apperteineth not vnto him to ſay vnto you ſuch vile and venemous wordes nor menaces: and therefore I aduiſe him, that he goe his way quickly, vnleſſe he ceaſe to ſpeake fooliſhly. Diomedes, that of nothing was aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, anſwered to Eneas and ſayd: Whatſoeuer thou be, thou ſheweſt well by thy words, that thou art right ill ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed, and hote in thy wordes: and I wiſh and deſire that I may once finde thee in a place conuenient, that I may rewarde thee for the wordes that thou haſt ſpoken of me. I ſee well that the king is fortunate and happie to haue ſuch a counſailer as thou art, that giueth him counſell to do villanie. Then Vliſſes brake the words of Diomedes
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:7118:249"/>
right wiſely, and prayed him to hold his peace, and after ſaide to king Priamus, we haue vnderſtood all that thou haſt ſaide, and wil go and report it vnto our princes. And incontinent they went, &amp; tooke their horſes, and returned vnto their hoſt, where they found many aſſembled before the king Agamemnon, and tolde to them the aunſwere of king Priamus: whereof they had great maruell, and conferred long together, for the well ordering of their affaires, ſince they were acertained of the warre of the Troyans.</p>

And albeit that the Greekes were leſſe in number then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were, they defended themſelues well: but their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence had not auailed them, had it not bene for the great proweſſe of Achilles, that did great marueiles with his body, as he that was the moſt ſtrong and moſt valiant of the Greeks: for whoſoeuer hee ſmote he died therefore, and there might no man endure before him. When then Achilles had eſpied the king Theutram in the middes of his people, that did great dammage to his folke, hee thru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted into the greateſt preaſe of his enemies, and beate downe before him all that he found vntill that hee came vnto the king Theutram: and hee gaue him ſo manie ſtrokes, that hee all to hewed his helme, and ſmote him downe to the grounde ſore wounded, and had ſlaine him incontinently had not Telephus beene, which put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe betwéene them, and prayed Achilles humbly, that he would not ſlay him, nor do him any more harme then hee had: and the king himſelfe cried to Achilles for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. Then ſayd Achilles to Telephus, what moueth thee to pittie our enemie mortall, that is come to aſſaile vs with ſo great furie: it is reaſon that hee fall into the pit that hee made ready for vs. Ha, ha, ſir, ſayd Telephus, this king was very familiar with my father Hercules, and alſo did to mee on a time, great honour in this land, and therefore I may not ſuffer to ſée him ſlaine before mine eyes. Well then, ſayd Achilles, take him, and doe
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:7118:250"/>
with him what thou wilt. Then was the battaile fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, and the Greekes ceaſed, and the king Theutram was borne into his Pallace as dead, for Achilles had ſore bruiſed him, and all to truſhed him. And the king praied Achilles and Thelephus, that they would go with him: the which went, and were receiued with great ioy and honour.</p>
                     <p>It was not long after, that the king Theutram, that was wounded to the death, by the woundes that Achil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les had giuen him, ſent for Achilles, and Thelephus, and then ſaid to them: My friends, I may not long liue: and after ſaid to Thelephus. My friend, I may no longer liue, and I haue no lawfull heires of my body, to whom I may leaue this realme, that I haue gotten with great labour, and had loſt long ſince, had it not béene the moſt worthy of all worthies, thy father Hercules, which war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted and was a ſhielde to mee againſt all them that would haue taken it from me: and hee did oft fight with them that would haue taken it. So thy father by his great proweſſe, ſlewe them and chaſed them out, and ſince I haue kept it peaceably, not by my merite, but by the vertue of thy father. And, ſince it is ſo that thy father hath conquered this realme for me, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> haue no heires, it is good right and reaſon that thou be heire of thy father: and forſomuch as this is my laſt worde, I leaue to thee this Realme and all mine other goodes, whereſoeuer they be, and make thee mine heire, and pray thée that thou doe bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie mée honourably, as it appertaineth to a king. And as ſoone as he had finiſhed theſe wordes he died, and then Thelephus, and the nobles of the countrey, did bury him honourably, and laide him in a very riche Sepulture, whereupon was written this Epitaph: Heere lieth the king Theutram, whom Achilles ſlew: the which left his realme to Thelephus.</p>
                     <p>This Thelephus, that before was but Duke, was made king of Meſſe: and all the nobles of the Countrey
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:7118:250"/>
did him homage, and all the people promiſed vnto him faith and ſeruice. Then Achilles did furniſh his ſhips with vittaile, and ordained that Thelephus ſhould abide in his new realme (which he did being ſore greeued) and he praied him, and alſo commaunded in the name of the Greekes, that hée ſhoulde doe his diligence, to ſend vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hoſte of the Greekes oftentimes vittailes: and hée promiſed him that hee ſo would doe without any default. And then Achilles tooke leaue of him, and returned into his ſhippes, and ſailed ſo long that he and his companie arriued at the porte of Tenedon ſafely, where they found the hoſte yet ſoiourning: and anon as he was landed, hee went ſtraite vnto the Tent of king Agamemnon, where all the princes and kinges were aſſembled: and there hée was receiued with great ioy, as hée that all the hoſte lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued much, for his great ſtrength and proweſſe. Then Achilles told to them, how he had arriued at Meſſe and of the battaile, and howe that Thelephus was made king, and howe he had promiſed to furniſhe the hoſte with vit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes.</p>
                     <p>Of theſe tidinges the Greekes had great ioy, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed and praiſed much the valiance of Achilles: and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Parliament each man went vnto his pauillion. Then was Achilles receiued with great ioy of his Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midones, that much loued him.</p>
                     <p>In this place heere, the authour nameth what kinges and princes did come to the helpe and aide of king Pria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus to Troy: not of all, but of the moſt notable.

                     <p>From the prouince of Tholoſon came foure Kinges, with fiue thouſand knightes armed, the King Carras, the king Amaſius, the king Neſtor, that was a mightie ſtrong man, and the King Amphimacus. From the Realme of Licie came the king Glaucon, with three

thouſand knightes, and his ſonne Sarpedon, that was one of the ſtrongeſt knightes of the worlde, and cooſin of king Priamus. From the realme of Licaon, came the king Enſemus, with three thouſand knightes right ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert in arms. From the realm of Lariſſa, came two kings with fiftéene hundred knightes, the king Miſtor that was a very great man, and the king Capidus. From the realme of Thabory came the king Remus, with three thouſand knightes, and in his company came foure dukes and ſeuen earles, that were in league with king Pria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus: they bare in their armes the colour of azure without other ſigne, and thereby was the king Remus and his people knowne in the battaile. From the realme of Thracie, came the king Pilex, and the duke Achanias, with xi. hundred knightes. From the realme of Panonie came the king Peſſemus, and the duke Stupex his cooſin, with thrée thouſand knights, right expert to iouſt and ſhoote with the bowe. This is a maruellous wild coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, of Forreſtes and Mountaines, and where is but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle people, and enough of wilde beaſts and of birds. From the prouince of Boecie, came three dukes, with twelue hundred knightes, the duke Anſerimus, the duke Fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, and the duke Sammus. From the realme of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin, where as growe good ſpices, came two kinges bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, with a thouſand knights, the king Boetes, and the king Epiſteus. From the raigne of Paphagore, that is at the ſunne riſing, in the Eaſt, full of all riches, came the right riche king Philemeus, with three thouſand knightes, all their ſhieldes of the hides of fiſhes all coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with gold and pretious ſtones, and this king was as great as a Giant. From the raigne of Ethiope, came the king Perſeus, and the king of Thiction with him, that was right hardie and wiſe, with three thouſand knights, that had in their companie manie a Duke and manie an Earle.</p>
                     <p>And alſo there was with them, Simagon, the ſonne of
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:7118:251"/>
king Thiction. From the realme of Cheres, came the king Theſeus and Archilogus his ſonne that was of the affinitie of king Priamus, &amp; brought a thouſand knights. From the Ile of Arguſt, came two kinges, of whom I haue not the names, with twelue hundred knightes. From the raigne of Eliane, that is beyond the realme of Amazon, came an auncient king right wiſe and diſcrecte, named Epiſtropus, and brought a thouſand knightes, and a maruellous beaſt that was called Sagittary, that behinde the middeſt was an horſe, and before a man, this beaſt was hairie, like an horſe, and had his eyes red as a coale, and ſhot right well with a bowe: and this beaſt made the Gréekes ſore afraid, and ſlewe many of them with his bowe. Thus were in number all the knightes that came in aide of king Priamus two and thirtie thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, beſides them of the realme of Troy, and of India the leſſer. And it is not found by writing that ſince the creation of the world ſo many noble knights were aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in one place, and that proſecuted the quarrell for ſo little occaſion. O howe the kinges and princes ought to take heed, and bée well aduiſed for to beginne warre, if they might amend it by another way.</p>

<pb n="490" facs="tcp:7118:252"/>
all noble and hardy men. And of his comming the Gréeks had great ioy, and murmured afore, becauſe hee taried ſo long, whereof hee excuſed him by ſickneſſe that he had</p>
                     <p>This Palamedes was holden in great worſhip a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Greekes, and was the ſecond next king Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memnon, puiſſant and diſcreet in armes, and very rich. And at his comming, hee was anon choſen to be counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of the hoſte. And thus were the Greekes many a day and night at the port of Tenedon, oftentimes aſſembled to counſell, for to aduiſe them in the beſt maner to beſiege the citie of Troy. And at length, after many opinions, they held them to the counſell of Diomedes, that was this. Now ſaid he, all ye Kinges, Princes and Barons, that be here aſſembled, we ought to haue great ſhame and diſlike, ſeeing it is a yeare agone ſince we landed heere in this countrey, and haue not yet been before Troy. Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, in this we haue giuen to our enemies great aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage: for it is ſo, that this time during, they bee purueied of great aids, and all their citie ſtrongly fortified, and fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with walles and bulwarkes, that they haue good ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to make: and verily they think that we be not ſo har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy as to come vnto them, and therefore the more that wée delay to go thither, the more increaſeth our ſhame and damage: and I trow if we hadde gone thither when wee came firſt into the countrey, wee ſhould haue more eaſily gone aſhore and taken land, then wee ſhall doe now: for they be better furniſhed now then they were at that time, of all ſuch thinges as them behooued, for to defend them with: and therefore, I councell you, that to morrowe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times we put vs on the way in good order, and let vs lay the ſiege firmely, and as haſtily as we may. We ought to know, that we ſhall not ſo doe without great battaile: Wherein it behooueth each man to employ himſelfe, and to put behinde all feare and dread. For by none other way we may preuaile in this matter, nor better nor more honourably, as I thinke, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="491" facs="tcp:7118:252"/>The counſell of Diomedes pleaſed all the Barons of the hoſte, and on the morrowe early they reentered into their ſhippes, and ſailed ſtraite vnto the porte of Troy, and brought their ſhippes by good order one after another.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt front they put an hundred ſhips right well furniſhed with knightes and banners, that waued in the wind, and after them they put another hundred: and after, all the other by order, and they hadde not farre ſailed, but that they ſawe the noble Citie of Troy, and approched thereto, as haſtily as they might. When the Troyans ſaw the Greekes approch the Citie, they ranne to armes, and mounted vpon their horſes all armed, and went forth without order vnto the porte. Then when the Greekes ſawe the Troyans come in ſo great number, for to defend their port, there was none ſo hardie but hee was afraid. But foraſmuch as they could not go a land, but by force of armes, they armed them incontinent, and did their beſt to take land by force, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Of the firſt hundred ſhippes, was chiefe and captaine, the King Protheſalaus of Philard, that indeuoured with great paine and diligence to bring his ſhippes within the porte: but the winde that was ſtrong, blew them into the porte ſo ſtrongly againſt the ſhore, that many of them brake and bruſed, and many Greekes were drowned, and they that might take land tooke it, and were anon ſlain by the Troyans with great tormentes, and in ſo great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that the ground was red with their bloud. It is not in the remembrance of any man that euer any Nauy wan land with ſo great damage as did the nauy of the Greeks. After this firſt hundred ſhippes, the other came and arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that followed them: and they that were within, were well prouided of great Arbaleſters, wherwith they did ſhoote and flew many of the Troyans, and conſtrained them to go backe.</p>
                     <p>And then with all ſpeede tooke the Greekes land, and
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:7118:253"/>
ſuccoured the firſt that fought at great deadly hazzard. Then beganne there a battaile. The king Protheſilaus, that was landed with the firſt, did great maruailes with his body, and ſlewe that day of the Troyans without number. And if he alone had not bene, all the Gréekes that were gotten a lande, had béene ſlaine. But what might his defence helpe, when ſeuen thouſand Greekes fought againſt an hundred thouſand Troyans? And I ſay to you, that for the great daunger wherein they felt themſelues, they ſolde their liues déere, abiding the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours of king Archelaus, and the king Prothenor that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>none arriued, and would the Troyans or not, they went aſhoare, tooke land, and ſuccoured their people valiant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and beganne againe cruell battell, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>After that arriued the duke Neſtor, and his folk, that thruſted in among their ennemies right fiercely. There was many a ſpeare broken, and many an arrow ſhotte: knights fell downe dead on both ſides, and the crie was ſo great, that it was maruellous to heare. There were ſlaine many Troyans by Archelaus &amp; Prothenor. After ariued the king Aſcalus, and the king Aglaus with their ſhips, and went aland, and aſſailed the Troyans with great fierceneſſe, and by force made them to retire and goe backe: and then came to the battell great plentie of new Troyans. Then beganne the battell to be greater then it had béene all the day before, in ſomuch that the Gréekes were reculed by force vnto their ſhippes, and then arriued Vlyſſes with a great company of knights which thronged anone into the battell: and the Gréekes recouered land at their comming, and aſſailed on the Troyans. There made Vlyſſes great effuſion of bloud of his ennemies, and immediately his enſigne was knowen among them. King Philomenus ſéeing that V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyſſes ſlew ſo their people, he addreſſed himſelfe to him, and beat him off his horſe a litle wounded. Vlyſſes ſmote him againe ſo hard, that he wounded him in his throate,
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:7118:253"/>
and cut aſunder his originall veine, and ſmote him as halfe dead. And the Troyans ranne and tooke him from the Gréekes, and bare him vpon his ſhield into the cittie. And had not this aduenture of this king béen, the Gréeks had béene diſcomfited. But the Troyans laboured much to ſaue him. Then arriued the king Thoas, and the king Agamemnon, the king Menelaus, and the king Thelamon Aiax, with all their power, and went a land, and fought a battell very valiantly, and brake their ſpeares, vpon the Troyans, and beate downe many, ſome ſlaine, and ſome hurt. At this ſkirmiſh were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Troyans.</p>
                     <p>When the king Protheſilaus departed from the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, where he had béene ſince the beginning, for to take breath, and when he came to the port, he found al his men nigh dead, for whom he wept for pittie, and tooke againe his courage, to auenge the death of his men, and went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine vnto the battell, and in his great yre ſlew many Troyans, and wounded them, and ſmote downe many of them off their horſes. Then came to the battell of the party of the Troyans, the king Perſes, with a great company of knights: at the comming of the Ethiopians beganne the battell to be mortall, and there were manie Gréekes ſlaine, and by maine force they made them goe backe, and had without faile diſcomfited them, had not the worthy Palamedes ſoone gone aland, for at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the Gréekes were recomforted. And alſo Palame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des did great maruells with his hand, and addreſſed him againſt Sagamon the brother of king Memnon, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew of the king of Perſe, that ſore gréeued the Gréekes: and he ſmote him ſo ſore with his ſpeare, that hée pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him through the body, and ſmote him dead downe to the earth: afterwards he thronged into the great preaſe, and beat downe all that hée mette, and eache man that knew him, made him way. And then aroſe a crie vpon the Troyans, ſo that they might not beare the ſtrength
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:7118:254"/>
of Palamedes, who were reculed by force, and had béene all diſcomfited. But the moſt worthieſt of all worthies, Hector, when he heard the cry vpon his people, hee iſſued out of the Citie, with a great company of knightes, and entered into the battaile, armed in rich armes, &amp; bare in his ſhield of golde, a Lion of Gules. His ſtrength was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non knowne among the Greekes: hee encountered and met in his comming the king Protheſilaus, that had not all day ceaſſed to ſlea Troyans: and hee ſmote him with his ſword, with ſo great might vpon his helme, that hee cleft him vnto the nauell, notwithſtanding his armour, whereof he fell downe to the ground. And after, Hector thruſted into the greateſt preaſe, and as many Greeks as he raught with his ſword, he ſlew. Then each man fledde from him, making him way, and then demaunded the Greekes one of another, what was hee that ſo greeued them, and ſtraight they knewe, that it was Hector the moſt ſtrong man of the world, and then was there none ſo hardie that durſt abide his ſtroke.</p>
                     <p>Then it happened, that Hector went out a little for to refreſh him: whereupon the Gréekes tooke courage again againſt the Troyans: and this happened that day, eight or ten times. It was about the houre of Euenſong what time Hector departed from the battaile, and reentred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Citie: for the Greekes were withall diſcomfited, and then arriued the right ſtrong Achilles with his may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ones, and entered anon into the battaile with three thouſand good knightes that were with him: and then were the Troyans on all ſides beaten downe and ſlaine, for againſt Achilles endured no man but hee was beaten downe to the earth, and ſore hurt.</p>
                     <p>Then were arriued all the Nauie of the Greekes, and the knightes gone a land, and ſkirmiſhed with the other in the battaile: wherefore the Troyans had much to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, ſo that they muſt needes flee into their citie, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chilles and the other ſlew them flying: there was a great
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:7118:254"/>
crie of the hurt men, and there was Achilles al died with the bloud of the Troyans that he hadde ſlaine, and there was great ſlaughter at the entry into the Citie. There ſawe the fathers their children ſlaine before their eyes: and the murther and the ſlaughter had been more great, if Troylus, Paris and Deiphebus had not come with a great companie fierce and new, who came and iſſued out of the Citie, reſiſted the Greekes and made the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ceaſſe, and for that the night was nigh, each man withdrew him into his place.</p>
                     <p>The Troyans kept cloſe their Citie, and did make good watch, and Achilles with the Greeks, returned to their Tentes with great glory, who were not yet dreſſed: but the king Agamemnon did cauſe to dreſſe them incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, and made each man to take place meete after his eſtate. And they that had no tentes nor pauilions, lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged then vnder the leaues, the beſt wiſe that they could, both themſelues and their horſes, and after ancred their ſhippes as well as they might, and tooke out of them all that was neceſſary to them. Thus made the Greekes their ſiege this night, and ſet it before the Citie of Troy, and made maruellous great fires in the hoſte, that made it as light as it had bin day. So were they lodged a night togither, and made right good watch, although they hadde none aſſaultes this night: and they hadde all the nightes Trumpets and Minſtrels great plentie, that Agamem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non ordained for to comfort the hoſte. And they reſted this night all armed the beſt wiſe they could. This was the firſt battel of the Gréeks, and of the Troyans, at their comming, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>Hector put in the fourth battell thrée thouſand knights and ſeuen hundred, whome hee tooke to conduct the king Huppon of Lariſſa.

The ſeuenth battell lead Eneas, and a noble admiral named Eufrene, and they went after the other. The eight battell lead the king of Perſe named Perſes, and Paris was chiefe and captaine, and Hector prayed Paris his brother, that hee would not aſſemble vnto the Greekes, vnto the time that he came himſelfe, and that hee woulde follow him anon. The much battell and the laſt lead Hector himſelfe, and
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:7118:256"/>
tenne of his baſtard brethren after him: and all the beſt knightes of the citie choſen, were in this battell, to the number of fiue thouſand, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Then when Hector was richly arrayed, and armed with good harneſſe and ſure, hee mounted vpon his horſe named Galathe, that was one of the moſt great &amp; ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt horſe of the world. And ſo (armed and mounted) he rode vnto the king his father, and ſayd vnto him: Right deare father, reteine with you a thouſand and fiue hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred knightes, and all the men of foote of this citie, and holde you without before the ſight of the Gréeks, &amp; moue you not, but if I ſend you word: to the end, if we haue ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie, that ye be our refuge. And I will ſend you alway among my meſſengers, that ſhall tell to you the ſtate of the battell: and take ye good heed, and kéepe good guard, that our enemies take not our citie by pollicie or treaſon. And the king anſwered him: My ſonne, I will doe all as thou haſt ſayde vnto me: for next after the ayde and helpe of the gods, thou art all my hope and truſt, and I haue no confidence but in the vertue of thine armes, and in the great diſcretion of thy wit. And I pray to the gods right humbly, that they will keepe thee whole and ſound, and preſerue thee from incombrance.</p>
                     <p>After theſe wordes, Hector went forth after the other. This Hector was very couragious, ſtrong, and victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in battaile, and a right wiſe conductor of menne of armes. His ſhield was all of golde, and in the middle a Lion of gules, and albeit that he was the laſt that iſſued out of his houſe or of the city, yet paſſed hee alway all the battels, and came and put himſelfe before in the firſt bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell. The women that were in the citie, and all the other went vpon the walles for to behold the battailes. There were the daughters of the king, with the queene Helene, that had great doubt, &amp; diuers imaginations in her ſelfe.</p>
                     <p>Whiles that Hector had ordeined his battels, the king Agamemnon was not idle, but ordeined right eare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:7118:256"/>
of his people, ſixe and twentie battels. He put in the firſt battell Patroclus with his people, &amp; with them the folke of Achilles, which was not that day in the battell, for his wounds that he had, and did ſtay to heale them in his tent. Thie Patroclus was a noble duke, and rich, and loued ſo much Achilles, that they were both of one alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. In the ſecond battell was the king Menon, and the king Idumeus with three thouſand knights: and there was the duke of Athens with all his people. The third battell lead the king Achalaphis, and his ſonne Phine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus with their people. The fourth battell lead the king Archelaus, and the king Prothenor his brother, and with him was Securidan the right ſtrong knight with all the people of Boecie.

Then Hector aſſailed Patroclus with his ſworde, and gaue him ſo great a ſtroke vpon his head, that he cleft it in two pieces: and Patroclus fell downe dead to the ground. When Hector ſawe him dead, hee coueted his armes, for they were right trimme and rich, and lighted downe off his horſe for to take them, but the king Menon came vpon him with three thouſand good knights, for to defend the king Patroclus againſt Hector, &amp; ſayd to him thus. Ha, ha, woolfe rauiſhing and inſatiable, certes it behooueth to ſéeke thy praye in ſome other place, for here getteſt thou none. And then they aſſailed on all ſides, and woulde haue taken from him Galathee his horſe. But Hector by his proweſſe remounted (woulde they or not) and meant to haue auenged him on king Menon, but the king Glaucion and the king Theſus and Archilogus his ſonne, came with three thouſande fighting men: And then Hector layed on and beat downe all afore him: and the firſt that hee met hee gaue ſo great a ſtroke, that hee ſlew him, and after him many more he beat downe, and flew.</p>
                     <p>Thus beganne the battell on both ſides, and Hector came againe to the bodie of Patroclus, for to haue his armes, but the king Idumeus of Crete, came againſt him with two thouſand fighting men, and the king Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non (that had alwayes his eyes to Hector) letted him, and was ſo in the way, that Hector might not haue his armes that hee moſt earneſtly deſired, and ſuffered great paine foraſmuch as he was on foot: but he enforced him with all his courage, and beganne to ſlay man and horſe, and to ſmite off heads, legges, féete and armes, and ſlew

fiftéene of the ſtrongeſt that aſſailed him. In this meane while, the king Menon tooke the body of Patroclus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and bare it vnto his tent. As the Greekes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to greeue Hector, and to take away his horſe, there was among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a ſtrong knight, named Cre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>With this crie came firſt Securabor one of the baſtard brethren of Hector, and thruſted into the greateſt preaſe ſo fierſly, that he came vpon them that moſt greeued Hec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, who had ſlaine more then thirtie of them, and did ſo much beſtirre him, that by force he made the Greekes to recule: and then was Hector remounted vpon his horſe, and thruſted in among them by great fierceneſſe, and ſlew great plentie of them, for diſpleaſure that hee might not haue the armes of Patroclus. Then hee met with none but he ſlew him, or beate him downe hurt, and each man made him way and dreaded him, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Then came to the battaile Meneſteus the duke of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, and came and ioyned him to the battaile whereas Troylus was, who did maruailes, and hadde with him the king Sampitus, the king Machaon, and the king Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canus. Then began fierſe battailes, Meneſteus addreſſed him againſt Troylus, and there fought againſt him with ſo great force, that he beate him downe of his horſe, in the great preaſe of the folke: and Meneſteus laboured with all his ſtrength, inſomuch that hee tooke him, and led him toward their tentes with a great companie of knightes. Then Miſeres of Troy cried to the Troyans, that Troy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus was priſoner, and that they ſhoulde be diſhonoured if they ſuffered him to be lead away. Then the king Alcanus tooke his ſpeare that was right ſtrong, and addreſſed him
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:7118:258"/>
vnto them that held Troylus, and ſmote the firſt downe to the earth, and ſmote another and ſore wounded him, and did ſo much by the aide of his men that Troylus was reſkewed, and ſet againe vpon his horſe, and alſo by the helpe of king Sampitus that came on with al his people, he gaue ſo great a ſtroke to Meneſteus ouerthwart, that if he had not been well armed, he had been ſlaine. And then cried Mneſteus to his people, and ſo began among them a mortall battaile, and there were many ſlaine on the one ſide and the other.</p>
                     <p>Among theſe thinges, Mneſteus, that was ſory that he had loſt his priſoner, met Miſeres, by whom he hadde loſt him, and aſſoone as he knew him, he addreſſed him to him and beate him downe, and the ſame time ſmote down another knight. Then came to the battaile Hupon, and Hiripiſus with two thouſand fighters, and againſt them came Menelaus and Prothenor with their folk, and there began a mortall ſkirmiſh, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Anon after came Polidamas the ſonne of Anthenor with a great company, and thruſted in on the other ſide among his enemies. After came the king Remus from Troy with three thouſand fighters, and againſt them came Menelaus with all his people. The ſaid Menelaus adreſſed him againſt king Remus, &amp; they iuſted togither, and ſmote each other to the ground. Then adreſſed him Polidamas, and Remus againſt the nephew of Helene a young man twentie yeare olde, and Remus gaue him ſo great a ſtroke with his ſpeare, that he ſmote him down to the earth, whereof Menelaus had great ſorrow, for hée loued him much, and in his great ire, hee gaue ſo great a ſtroke to Remus with his ſword, that he ſmote him down as dead. And when the king Remus was ſo beaten down, his men had we end that he hadde been dead, and woulde haue fledde had it not been for Polidamas that retained them with great paine, and did ſo much that they tooke their king ſo hurt as hee was, and bare him home in

ſafetie. Then the king Celidus, that was the moſt faire king of the world, adreſſed him to Polidamas, and ſmote him with his ſpeare, but he could not remooue him, Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damas gaue him ſo great a ſtroke with his ſword, that he ſmote him downe to the earth. Among all theſe thinges Hector went and came beating downe and ſlaying his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, and made way before him in ſlaying of knightes and beating downe, ſo farre that he came vppon them of Salamine that the king Thelamon conducted, who ſlew many of the Troyans, and beate downe by his proweſſe. Then the king Theuter gaue ſo great a ſtroke with his ſpeare to Hector, that he made him a deepe wound: and Hector in his great ire encountered an admirall of the Greekes, and ſlew him cruelly with his ſword. Then was Hector cloſed with his ennemies on all partes: there was of the Greekes the king Theſus, and he ſpake to Hector and warned him that he ſhould go out of the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, and ſaide that it were damage for all the worlde to looſe ſuch a knight: and Hector thanked him right courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly.</p>
                     <p>In this while Menelaus and Thelamon aſſailed Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damas: and Thelamon that adreſſed him firſt, ſmote him with his ſpeare, and after gaue many ſtrokes, inſomuch that they brake the lace of his helme, and tooke him, and had lead him away had not Hector been, which was not farre off, who ſmote among them that held him and ſlew and hurt many of them, and did ſo much by his valiaunce that he ſlewe thirtie of them: and the other fled, and left Polydamas with him. Then there put them togither, the king Menelaus, and the king Thelamon, with al their people, and ſmote in among <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And then was his fierſe and gallant warlike horſe Galathe ſlaine vnder him, and then hée defended himſelfe on
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:7118:259"/>
foote ſo maruellouſly that there was none ſo hardy of the Greekes that durſt approche him. When his brethren knew the right great daunger that he was in, they ranne al to that part. Then was Thelamon ſore hurt, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadorous one of the baſtard brethren of Hector, gaue ſo great a ſtroke to Polixenus a noble man, that hee ſlewe him, and beate him downe of a great and a ſtrong horſe, whereupon he ſate, and tooke the Steed to Hector, who mounted vpon him incontinent. There were maruailes of armes done by the baſtards. Then came on Deyphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus with all his hoſte, wherein he hadde great ſtore of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers that hurt and ſlew great ſtore of the Greekes. And Deyphebus made &amp; gaue to king Theuter a great wound in the viſage. Then beganne the battaile as mortall as it had been in all the day. There was Theſus aſſailed by Quintelinus one of the baſtard brethren of Hector, and of king Moderus, and was taken and lead away: but Hector deliuered him all quite, for the courteſie that he had done to him a little before.</p>
                     <p>Then came to the battell of the Greeks, the king Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, and the king Philotas: but the king Thaos addreſſed him againſt Caſſilanus one of the baſtard brethren of Hector, and gaue him ſo great a ſtroke, that hee ſlew him downe to the earth, ſeeing Hector, which then ſmote ſo angerly among the Greekes, that hee ſlewe many, and put them all to flight. Then came to the battaile Neſtor with ſixe thouſand knightes: and the king Eſdras, and the king Philon, that did great maruels of armes, came againſt them.</p>
                     <p>At this aſſembly there were many knightes ſlaine, and beaten downe, of the one part and of the other. The king Philon, that did great maruailes in armes, was encloſed with the Greekes on all ſides, and hadde béene ſlain, if Iecomas and the king Eſdras his father had not deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him from their handes. Hector and his brother did
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:7118:259"/>
maruailes, with Polydamas, and had put all the Gréeks to flight, but Menelaus and Thelamon reſiſted them ſtrongly.</p>
                     <p>Then came Eneas to the battaile with all his hoſte, and put him in with Hector and the other, and by force put the Greekes to plaine flight, whereof Aiax had verie great ſorrowe: and alſo as hee beheld behinde him, he ſaw the banners that came to the battaile that hadde not yet been there, and there was all the floure of the chiualry of Greece. Then praied he them that fled, that they would abide, and recommence and beginne a new battaile. Aiax and Eneas encountered ſo hardlie, that they fel both to the earth. And then came Phylotes with three thouſand knights, and made the Troyans go backe, and ſmote Hector with his ſpeare, but hee might not remooue him: and Hector gaue him ſo great a ſtroke with his ſworde, that he beate and ſore hurt him. Then came to the battell the king Humerus, and the king Vliſſes with all their people, and the king Humerus, and they hadde in their hoſte tenne thouſand knightes, the which did the Troy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans much ſorrowe that were very weary. To their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours came Paris vnto the battaile, and in his comming ſmote ſo hard the king of Frigie, who was cooſin to V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſſes, that he ſlew him and beate him down, whereof the Greekes had much ſorrow: and Vliſſes ſuppoſed to haue ſmitten Paris with his ſpeare, but hee ſmote his horſe and ſlew him, and Paris fell to the earth. Then Troylus gaue to Vliſſes ſo great a ſtroke, that he wounded him in the face, and made the bloud ſpring out like as the wine runneth out of a tunne, &amp;c. and Vliſſes hurt him againe. And truely the Troyans had then fled, had it not béen for the great proweſſe of Hector, and of his brethren: for Hec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor ceaſſed not to put himſelfe in the greateſt preaſe, here and there, and each man that knew him made him way.</p>
                     <p>When he ſaw that his people might not ſuffer the great ſtrength of the Gréekes, he withdrew them on a ſide, and
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:7118:260"/>
told them what iniuries the Greekes had done to them, and what they will doe if they come to their conqueſt, and then admoniſhed and warned them to doe well, and after brought them by a valley on the right ſide for to aſſaile their enemies. There was great ſlaughter of the Gréeks: there was the king Thoas aſſailed of the baſtard brethren of Hector, for to auenge the death of Caſſibelanus their brother, that he had ſlaine: they beate him downe off his horſe, and raſed off his helme from his head, and hadde ſlaine him incontinent, if the duke of Athens hadde not come on, that thruſted in among them, and gaue ſo great a ſtroke to one of the baſtardes Quintilinus, that he fell downe to the ground ſore hurt: and Paris ſmote the duke with an arrow in the ſide, and made him a great wound. But the duke that was ſore hurt, ſet not thereby, but maugre them all, he deliuered the king Thoas from their handes. Then Hector did indeuour to put the Greekes vnto flight, and then the king Humerus ſhotte an arrow vnto Hector, and hurt him in the face, and Hector ranne vpon him by ſo great ire, that hee ſmote him ſore vppon the head, and cleft it vnto the teeth, and hee fell downe dead. Then, with blowing of an horne, came more then ſeuen thouſand Greekes for to aſſaile Hector that defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him againſt them merueilouſly. After this he went a litle off to his father, and took three thouſand knightes freſh and fierſe, and brought them to the battaile, and at their comming hee made verie great ſlaughter of the Greekes, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Aiax and Hector iouſted togither, and fought each with other, Menelaus ſlew at this ioyning an admirall of Troy. Celidonius ſlew Moles of Oreb the nephew of King Thoas. Mandon ſmote out an eie of king Sedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius. Sadellus ſlew an admirall of the Greekes. The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamon beate Margareton and ſore wounded him. Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel beate the king Prothenor to the earth. The king of Gaul iouſted againſt Mneſteus, but Mneſteus hurt him
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:7118:260"/>
on the noſe with his ſword. Then Dianor ſéeing his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hurt, addreſſed him to Mneſteus, and ſmote him down to the earth: and then fell vpon him the three bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren that would haue ſlaine him, or taken him, but hée defended him valiantly, and anon hee was ſuccoured by the king Theuter. But Hector then aſſailed them both, and without fault they had not eſcaped, had not Aiax the ſtrong knight haue come to the reſkewe with a thouſand knightes that he had in his company. Then came on the king of Perſe with fiue thouſand knightes that Paris lead: and ſo did all the other Troyans, and made the Greekes recule, and go backe by force. Dares writeth in his booke, that Hector ſlew a thouſand knightes, onely in this aſſault.</p>
                     <p>Among all other thinges Hector encountered the king Menon before a tent, and ſaid to him: ha, euill traytour, the houre is come that thou ſhalt receiue thy reward for that thou letteſt me to take the armes of Patroclus: and then he ſmote him ſo great a ſtroke that he fell downe to the ground. And after Hector alighted downe, &amp; ſmote off his head, and would haue taken his armes from him: but Mneſteus letted him, and ſmote vppon Hector ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwart, by ſuch force that hee gaue him a great wound, and went his way without more carrying, doubting the fury of Hector. Then Hector went out of the throng, and did binde vp his wound that it bled no more, and after went in againe into the preaſe, and ſlew in his comming many Greekes. And Dares ſaith, that after he had bound vp his wound, he ſlew the ſame day a thouſand knights, &amp; there was none had courage to auenge him againſt him or defend himſelf, but he put them al to flight, &amp; the Troians entered into their tents and pilled and robbed them, and tooke all the beſt that they could finde, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>On this day had y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Troyans had victory of the Greeks, if fortune had conſented: for they might haue ſlaine the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al, and eſchewed great euils that after came to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Certes it
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:7118:261"/>
is not wiſedome, when any man findeth his ennemy in great perill and fortune, to offer his power to deliuer him thereof: for it happeneth oftentimes, that he ſhall neuer recouer to haue his enemy in the ſame caſe, but that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune will turne her backe: Thus it happened this day to the vnhappie Hector, that had the better of his enne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and might haue ſlaine them all, if he hadde would, for they ſought nothing but for to ſlea. When by great miſaduenture there came afore him in an encounter The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamon Aiax that was ſonne of king Thelamon, and Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that was cooſin Germaine of Hector and of his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, which was wiſe and valiant, he addreſſed him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Hector, and deliuered to him a great aſſault, and Hector to him, as they that were valiaunt both two: and as they were fighting, they ſpake and talked to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither, and thereby Hector knew that he was coſin Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine, ſonne of his aunt: and then Hector for courteſie embraced him in his armes, and made great chéere, and offered to him to doe all his pleaſure, if hee deſired any thing of him, and praied him that he would come to Troy with him, for to ſee his linage ot his mothers ſide: but the ſaid Thelamon, that intended to nothing but to his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntage, ſaide that he would not go at this time. But praied Hector, requeſting that if he loued him ſo much as he ſaid, he woulde for his ſake, and at his inſtance, ceaſſe the battaile for that day, and that the Troyans ſhoulde leaue the Greekes in peace. The vnhappy Hector accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to him his requeſt, and blewe a horne, and made all his people to withdraw into the Citie. Then hadde the Troyans begunne to put the fire in the ſhippes of the Greekes, and had all burnt them, had not Hector called them from thence: Wherefore the Troyans were ſory of their repeale.</p>
                     <p>This was the cauſe wherefore the Troyans miſſed ſo haue the victorie, to the which they might neuer after at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, nor come: for fortune was to them contrary: and
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:7118:261"/>
therefore Virgile ſaith: <hi>Non eſt miſericordia in bello,</hi> that that is to ſay, that there is no mercy in battaile. A man ought not to be too mercifull, but take the victory when he may get it.</p>

Priamus the king did bury his baſtard ſonne Caſſibela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus right honourably, in the temple of Venus and ſhewed great ſorrowe for his death, and ſo did all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>When Caſſandra heard the greefe and ſorrow that the Troyans made for the death of their friendes, ſhee cried and ſaid: O vngracious Troyans, make ſorrow for your ſelues, for in likewiſe ſhall it happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and come to you as it is to your friendes, that is the death: alas why ſeeke yée

not peace of the Gréekes, before theſe euils come to you, and ere this noble citie bee deſtroied? alas why yeelde you not againe Helene, that the king my father did cauſe to rauiſh by force, wherefore yee ſhall all be deſtroied? Among all theſe thinges, Palamedes murmured greatly at the ſeignory of Agamemnon, ſaying that hee was not worthy to haue ſo great domination aboue all the other, and that he himſelfe was more worthy to haue the ſeig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nory of the hoſte, then Agamemnon: and that hee had not the good will and conſent of the princes, but only of three or foure: and then at that time there was nothing fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proceeded.</p>
                     <p>When the truce failed, the king Agamemnon that had the charge of all the hoſte, ordered right early his bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes, and gaue the firſt to Achilles, and the ſecond to Diomedes, the third to Menelaus, the fourth to Mene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteus the duke of Athens, and ouer all the other he ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned good captaines and conductors. Hector ordered his battailes in like wiſe, and ſet in the firſt Troylus, and in all the other he ſet good captaines and hardy, and made all the battailes to iſſue out: and hee ſet himſelfe in the front before. And when Achilles ſawe him, hee ranne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, ſo that they ſmote each other to the earth right ſore. Hector remounted firſt, and left Achilles lying on the earth, and ſmote in among the other, in the greateſt preaſe, and he raught no knight but he ſlew him, or beate him downe: and went throughout the battaile all made red with the bloud of them that he had ſlaine. When A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chilles was remounted, he thruſted in among the Troy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in the great preaſe, and ſlew many: and hee went ſo farre, that he encountered Hector againe, and he ranne to him, and Hector to him, but Achilles was borne downe to the ground: and Hector woulde haue taken his horſe, but he might not, for the great ſuccors that Achilles had. When hee was remounted, hée aſſailed Hector with his ſword, and gaue ſo great ſtrokes to Hector, that nigh hée
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:7118:262"/>
had beaten him: but Hector gaue to him ſo great a ſtroke vppon the helme, that he ouerthrew him, and made the bloud ſpring out of his head. Thus was the battell mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall of the two knightes: and if they had not béen parted the one from other, they had béene ſlaine: but their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple put aſunder them. Then came Diomedes to the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, and Troylus on the other ſide, which ſmote each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the earth. But Dyomedes remounted firſt, and aſſailed Troylus, that was on foote, and defended him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf valiantly, and ſlew the horſe of Dyomedes: but their men remounted them both two, by force, and then they began againe to ſkirmiſh. And Dyomedes had taken and lead away Troylus, if the Troyans had not put them in perill of death, for to reſkew him: and many of them were ſlain. Then came to the battaile Menelaus of the Gréeks ſide, and Paris on the other ſide: and thus going and comming Hector ceaſſed not to ſlea, and to beate downe knightes. Then there was a new knight named Brietes that aſſailed him fierſly, but Hector by right great ire ſmote him vpon the Helme, ſo great a ſtroke, that he cleft his head vnto the nauell, and hee fell downe dead: but Archilogus his cooſin ſéeing that Hector woulde haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken his horſe, Archilogus defended him, aſmuch as hée might: and then Hector ranne vpon him, and ſmote him ſo hard, that hee ſmote his body in two peeces notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his harneis. The king Prothenor addreſſed him to Hector that then tooke no regard nor heede, and ſmote him downe to the earth.</p>
                     <p>And Hector remounted anon vpon his horſe, and gaue to king Prothenor ſo great a ſtroke with all his might, that hée cleft body in two halues: Achilles that was his parent or cooſin ſeeing that, had ſo great ſorrow, that hee and the king Archelaus contended to reuenge his death.</p>
                     <p>But the Troyans did come vppon him with ſuch cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and warlike ſtrength, that the Greekes fainted and

And they ſaid, that as long as hée were aliue, and came to battaile againſt them, they might neuer vanquiſh the Troyans: but he ſhould to them doe great damage. And for to bring this thing to the end, they requeſted Achilles, that hee woulde take it vppon him, as well for his ſtrength as for his wiſedome. And Achilles enterpriſed it gladly, as hee that wiſt that Hector deſired more his death, then the death of any other: and alſo Hector was hee, by whom he might ſooneſt looſe his life. After this counſell they went to reſt, till on the morrowe betime they armed them. And Hector was then iſſued out of the Citie with his battailes well and diligently ordered, and was himſelfe before all other in the firſt bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile. And after him came Eneas, and then Paris, and then Deyphebus, and after him Troylus, and after him the other following each in his order. Then ioyned all the Troyans togither, and were more then an hundred thouſand fighting men. Then began the battaile horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and mortall. Paris with them of Perſe, that were

good knightes, ſlew with ſhot many Gréeks, and hurted them. Hector encountred the king Agamemnon &amp; beate him, and wounded him ſore. And then Achilles aſſayled Hector, and gaue him ſo many ſtrokes, that he brake his helme. Then Eneas and Troylus came to the reſcue of Hector, and Diomedes came vppon that, who addreſſed him to Eneas, and beat him, and ſayd to him in mocke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: Ha, ha, good counſeller, that gaueſt counſell to thy king to offend and grieue me, know thou for trueth, that if thou come oft into theſe battels, and that I may méete with thée, thou ſhalt not eſcape without death.</p>
                     <p>Among theſe things, Hector aſſailed Achilles, and gaue to him ſo many ſtrokes, that hee all to fruſhed and brake his helme, and wéened to haue taken him: but the ſonne of Guideus ranne vpon Hector, and gaue him ſo great a ſtroke with his ſword, that he did hurt him very ſore. And Hector in his ire encountred Diomedes, and gaue him ſo great a ſtroke, that he beat him downe to the ground. Then Troylus alighted, and deſcended downe for to fight with Diomedes on foote: but Diomedes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended himſelfe ſo valiantly, that was marueile. And beſide them fought together Hector and Achilles. Then came to the ſkirmiſh all the kings and princes of Gréece, with a great company of men of armes: and from the partie of the Troyans came all the Barons that were come for to ayde them. There beganne marueilouſly the battell. The king Agamemnon and the king Pandolus fought together, the king Menelaus encountred Paris, and they knew ech other well, and Menelaus ſmote him ſo hard with his ſpeare, that he gaue gim a great wound, and ſmote him downe, whereof Paris was all aſhamed. Vliſſes beat the king Araſtous, and tooke his horſe that was very good, and ſent it to his tent. Polimites aſſayled Huppon the ancient, and ſlew him. Neoptolemus &amp; the king Archilogus fought together. Polidamas beat Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamedes, and wounded him very ſore, and after mocked

him by reproch. The king Selenus, and the king Carras encountred together, and Carras was ſore beaten and wounded. Philomenus beat Anthenor. Philoteas and the king Remus fought together. The king Theſus and the king Enrialus fought together, and both were ſore hurt. And the baſtards of king Priamus did marueiles, and ſlew mane Gréeks, and hurt many kings. The king Thelamon, and the king Sarpedon iouſted ſo ſore, the one againſt the other, that they fell both ſore hurt, and all aſtonied of the anguiſh that they had. The king Thoas and Achilles that were couſins, aſſailed Hector, and gaue him many ſtrokes, and drew off his helme from his head, and hurt him in many places: and Hector gaue to him ſo great a ſtroke with his ſword, that he cut off halfe his noſe.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen it came on the morrow betimes, the king Priamus would not that they ſhould fight that day, but ſent for his councell, that is to witts, Hector, Paris, Troylus and Deiphebus, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas, Anthenor, and Polidamas, and ſayde vnto them: Ye know how wee holde priſoner the king Thoas, that without any euill that wee haue deſerued, is come for to deſtroy vs: and therefore mee thinketh good, that wee make him die an euill death. What ſay ye thereto? Ha ſir, ſayd Eneas, the gods forbidde that your nobles ſhould do ſuch a villanie, ſince it is ſo that the king Thoas is one of the moſt noble kings of Gréece, for that it might hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen that the Gréekes might take one of ours, to whome they might do in ſemblable wiſe, whereof ye might take the greateſt griefe and ſorrow in the worlde. So then it is better, as mee thinketh, that yee keepe right well and ſafe the king Thoas, without miſdoing vnto him, that if by fortune one of ours were taken, wee might make an exchange, and take the one for the other. This counſell ſéemed good and pleaſing to Hector, but the king Pria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus ſayd vnto them, Yet, if ye doe thus, it ſhall ſéeme to the Gréekes that we doubt them, and that wee dare not put their folke to death: notwithſtanding, I will doe by your counſell. This counſell finiſhed, Eneas tooke Troy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus and Anthenor, and went to ſee Helene, whome they found in the great hall of Ilyon with the Queene Hecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba, and many other noble Ladies, where ſhe made great
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:7118:265"/>
ſorrow, and they ſuppoſed then to haue comforted her, and ſo did the Quéene Hecuba, that ſayd to her that ſhe ſhould take no thought nor ſorrowe, and that they of the Citie ſhould well defend them.</p>
                     <p>Among theſe things the Gréekes complained verie ſore of the death of their friendes that the Troyans ſlew thus, and held themſelues very children that they had put themſelues in ſuch danger, wherefrom they had wel paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and béene deliuered, if they had had good counſell: and yet it happened that ſame night, that there came ſo great a winde, and ſo great a raine, that their Tents were all turned vpſide downe to the earth, and it ſéemed that the world ſhoulde haue ended by the great ſtorme, whereat her ſorrow was doubled. When it came to the morning, that the tempeſt was paſſed, they armed themſelues all thorowout the hoſte, and went againſt the Troyans, that then were iſſued to battell. Achilles addreſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe firſt to Hupon, that was great as a Giant, and was king of Lariſſa, and hee ſmote him ſo ſore with a ſpeare in the breaſt, that hee ſlewe him, and bare him downe to the earth. Hector ſlew in his comming the king Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meus. Diomedes ſlewe the king Antipus. Then the king Epiſtropus, and the king Cedus aſſailed Hector, and Epiſtropus iouſted againſt Hector, and brake his ſpeare vpon him, and ſayde vnto him many villanous wordes, whereat Hector was woonderfull angry, and in his excéeding great ire gaue him ſuch a ſtroke, that he ſlew him, and afterward ſayd vnto him, that he ſhould go and ſay his villainous wordes to them that were dead, ſuch as he was woont to ſay to liuing men. Then was Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus paſſing ſorrowfull for the death of his brother, and admoniſhed a thouſand knights, that he meant for to ſlay Hector: and they aſſailed him anon, and beat him off his horſe, and they cried to the king Cedus for to ſlay Hector. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Hector perceiued that, he gaue him ſuch a ſtroke that he cut off his arme, wherewith he fel, for the anguiſh
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:7118:265"/>
that hee felt: and anon Hector ſlewe him. Eneas ſlewe in this ſkirmiſh the king Amphymacus, and then went togither all the moſt puiſſant of Greeks, and aſſailed the Troyans, and ſlew many of them, and they went with ſo great force that they put the Troyans in a chaſe, in the which Achilles ſlewe the king Philes, whereof Hector had great ſorrow: and in his ire he ſlew the king Dalpme and the king Doreus, and thus by the puiſſance of Hec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, the Troyans recouered the field, and flewe many Greekes, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Then iſſued out of Troy the king Epiſtropus with three thouſand knightes, and they brake rankes, and thruſted among the Greekes, that reculed in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming: foraſmuch as he brought with him a Sagittary, the ſame that afore is made mention of. This Sagittary was not armed, but hee bare a ſtrong bowe and a quiuer that was full of arrowes, and ſhot ſtrongly. When the knightes of the Gréekes ſaw this maruellous beaſt, they had no will to go forth, and they that were afore began to withdraw them, and went backe. Among theſe thinges Hector ſlew Polixenes, the noble duke that fought ſore againſt him, for by the ſtrength of the Troyans &amp; the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of the Sagittary, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Greeks were driuen back to their tentes. It happened that Diomedes before one of the tentes was aſſailed of the Sagittary, and had this beaſt before him, and the Troyans on his backe, ſo that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooued him there to ſhew his puiſſance. The Sagittarie had then ſhot an arrow to him, and Diomedes that was not well aſſured, aduaunced him nigh vnto him, &amp; gaue him ſo great a ſtroke with his ſworde, who was not ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that he ſlew him, and that time it was paſt midday, and then the Greekes recouered the field, and made the Troyans to flee. And then encountred Hector and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chilles, and with force of their ſpeares they fought both two and fell both to the earth: And as Achilles was firſt remounted, they ſuppoſed to haue lead away Galathe the

good horſe of Hector: but Hector cried to his folke, that they ſhould not ſuffer him to leade him away. Then they ran vpon Achilles, and did ſo much, that they recouered Galathe, and rendred him to Hector, that was right glad of him. At this ſkirmiſh was Anthenor taken and ſent to their tentes, notwithſtanding that Polidamas his ſonne did maruailes of armes, for to reſkew him, but he might not: and thus they fought to great damage of the one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and of the other, vntill the night parted them.</p>

This truce during, the king Thoas was deliuered in the ſteed of Anthenor that they held priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, whom they ſent to the Troyans. Calcas that by the commaundement of Apollo had left the Troyans, hadde a paſſing faire daughter and wife named Briſeyda. Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer

                     <p>The truce during, Hector went on a day vnto the tents of the Greekes, and Achilles behelde him gladly, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as hee had neuer ſeen him vnarmed. And at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of Achilles, Hector went into his Tent, and as they ſpake togither of many thinges, Achilles ſaide to Hector, I haue great pleaſure to ſee thee vnarmed, foraſmuch as I haue neuer ſeen thée before. But yet I ſhal haue more pleaſure, when the day ſhall come that thou ſhalt die of my hand, which thing I moſt deſire. For I knowe thee to be very ſtrong, and I haue oftentimes prooued it, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the effuſion of my bloud, whereof I haue great anger: and yet haue much more great ſorrow, foraſmuch as thou ſleweſt Patroclus, him that I moſt loued of the worlde. Then thou maieſt beleeue for certain, that before this yeare bee paſt, his death ſhalbe auenged vppon thee, by my hand, and alſo I wote well, that thou deſireſt to ſlea mee.</p>
                     <p>Hector aunſwered and ſaide, Achilles, if I deſire thy death, maruell thou nothing thereof: foraſmuch as thou deſerueſt to bee mine ennemie mortall: thou art come into our land for to deſtroie mee and mine. I will that thou knowe, that thy wordes feare mee nothing at all, but yet I haue hope that within two yeare, if I liue, and continue in health, and my ſworde faile mée not, thou ſhalt die by the force and valor of mine handes,<pb n="520" facs="tcp:7118:267"/>
not thou alonely, but all the moſt greateſt of the Gréeks, for among you yee haue enterpriſed a great folly, and it may none otherwiſe come to you thereby but death: and I am aſſured that thou ſhalt die of mine hand, ere I ſhal die by thine. And if thou thinke that thou bee ſo ſtrong, that thou maieſt defend thée againſt mee, make it ſo that all the barons of thine hoſte promiſe and accord that wee fight body againſt body, and if it happen that thou van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh me, that my friendes and I ſhalbe baniſhed out of this realme, and we ſhall leaue it vnto the Greekes, and thereof I ſhall leaue good pledge. And heerein thou maieſt profite to many other, that may run in great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, if they haunt the battaile: and if it happen that I vanquiſhe thee, make that all they of thy hoſte depart hence, and ſuffer vs to liue in peace. Achilles chafed ſore with theſe wordes, and offered him to fight this battaile, and gaue to Hector his gage, which Hector tooke and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued gladly, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>When Agamemnon knewe of this offer and bargaine, he went haſtily vnto the Tent of Achilles, with a great company of noble men, which woulde in no wiſe accord nor agrée to this battaile, ſaying that they would not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them, ſo many noble men vnder the ſtrength of one man: and the Troyans ſaid in like maner, ſaue only the king Priamus that would gladly agree, for the great ſtrength that he found in his ſon Hector. Thus was the fight broken, and Hector departed and went againe to Troy, from the Gréekes.</p>
                     <p>When Troylus knew certainly that Briſeyda ſhould be ſent to her father, he made great ſorrow, for ſhee was his ſoueraigne ladie of loue, and in ſemblable wiſe Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeyda loued earneſtly Troylus: and ſhee made alſo the greateſt ſorrow of the worlde for to leaue her ſoueraigne lord in loue.

that Chaucer made, wherein hee ſhall finde the ſtorie whole, which were too long to write heere: but finally Briſeyda was led vnto the Greekes whom they receiued honourably.</p>
                     <p>Among them was Diomedes that anon was enfla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with the loue of Briſeyda, when he ſawe her ſo faire, and in riding by her ſide hee ſhewed to her all his minde, and made to her many promiſes, and eſpecially deſired her loue: and then when ſhe knew the minde of Dyomedes. ſhe excuſed her, ſaying, that ſhe would not agree to him, nor refuſe him at that time, for her heart was not diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at that time to anſwere otherwiſe. Of this anſwers Diomedes had great ioy, foraſmuch as hee was not refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vtterly, and hée accompanied her vnto the tent of her father, and did helpe her downe of her horſe, and tooke from her one of her gloues that ſhee held in her handes, and ſhe ſuffered him ſweetly. Calcas receiued her with great ioy, and when they were in priuitie between them both, Briſeyda ſaide to her father theſe and ſemblable wordes.</p>

<pb n="524" facs="tcp:7118:269"/>
for to auenge his death the Greekes ſlew manie of the Troyans. Achilles ſlewe many noble men, among the which he ſlew the duke Byraon, and Euforbe, that was a great noble man. Hector was this day ſore hurt in the face, and bled great plentie of bloud, and wiſt not who had done it, &amp; therefore the Troyans reculed vnto the walles. And when Hector apparantly ſawe vppon the walles, the quéen Hecuba his mother, and his ſiſters, he had great ſhame, and by great ire aſſailed the king Menon cooſin of Achilles, and gaue him ſo many ſtrokes with his ſword vpon his helme, that he ſlew him in the ſight of Achilles, that was like for to haue been madde, and tooke a ſtrong ſpeare, and ranne againſt Hector, and brake his Speare vpon him, but he could not remoue him: and Hector gaue him with his ſword ſo great a ſtroke, that he made him to tumble vnder his horſe, and ſaid to him: Achilles, Achil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, thou contendeſt to approch to me, know that thou ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procheſt thy death. And as Achilles would haue aunſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to Hector, Troylus came betweene them with a great number of knightes, and put them in the middeſt of them.

Then beganne the battaile horrible and mortall, and the Greekes recouered the field, and chaſed and put the Troyans back vnto their diches. Then came Polidamas to the reſkew, with a great number and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of knightes, and did goodly exploites of warre: and Diomedes addreſſed him to him, but hee was beaten of Polidamas that tooke the horſe of Diomedes, and deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it to Troylus that fought on foote, and he mounted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non thereupon.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>Vring the ſix monethes of the truce afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaide, Hector ſought to bee healed of his woundes, and plaied in the noble hall of Ilyon, that was (as the hiſtorie ſaith) the moſt royall hall and faire that was in the world. Thus during the truce, the king Priamus did bury his ſixe baſtard ſonnes each in a ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by himſelfe right honourably. Among all other thinges, Diomedes ſuffered great greefe for the loue of Briſeyda, and might not eat nor reſt for thinking on her, and required her many times of her loue, and ſhe anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him right wiſely, giuing him hope without certaintie of any point: by the which Diomedes was enflamed on all parts with her loue. When the ſixe monethes were paſſed, they beganne to fight by the ſpace of twelue daies continually from the morning vnto the euening, &amp; there were many ſlaine of the one ſide and of the other. And then came a great mortalitie among the Greekes in the hoſte, by the great heate that then was: and therefore the king Agamemnon required truce, which was agreed and accorded to him, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>When the truce was paſſed, the night before, Andro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meda the wife of Hector that had two faire ſonnes by him: whereof the one had to name Laomedon, and the other Aſtromates, this Andromeda ſawe that night a maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous viſion, and her ſeemed if Hector went that day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing to the battaile, he ſhould be ſlaine. And ſhe that
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:7118:270"/>
had great feare and dread of her huſband, weeping ſaide to him, praying him that he would not go to the battaile that day: whereof Hector blamed his wife, ſaying, that ſhe ſhoulde not beleeue nor giue faith to dreames, and would not abide nor tarrie therefore. When it was in the morning, Andromeda went vnto the king Priamus, and to the Queene, and tolde to them the veritie of her viſion: and praied them with all her heart that they woulde doe ſo much at her requeſt, as to diſſwade Hec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor that hee ſhould not in any wiſe that day go to the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>It happened, that day was faire and cléere, and the Troyans armed them, and Troylus iſſued firſt into the battaile, after him Eneas, after Paris, Deiphebus, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidamas, and the king Sarpedon, the king Epiſtropus, the king Croys, and the king Philomenus, and after all the princes that were come in the aide of the Troians, each man in good order. And the king Priamus ſent to Hector that he ſhould keepe him well that day from going to battaile. Wherefore Hector was angry, and ſaid to his wife many wordes reprochfull, as he that knew well that this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement came by her requeſt, yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> forbidding, he armed him: And when Andromeda ſawe him armed, ſhee tooke her little Children, and fell downe at the feete of her huſband, and praied him humbly, that hee woulde take off his armes: but hee would not doe it. And then ſhe ſaid to him, at the leaſt if yee will not haue mercie on me, yet haue pitie on your litle children, that I and they die not a bitter and gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous death or that wee bée not lead into ſeruitude and bondage into ſtrange countries.</p>
                     <p>At this inſtant came the queene Hecuba and the quéene Helene, and the ſiſters of Hector, and they humbled themſelues and kneeled downe preſently before his feet, and praied and deſired him with wéeping teares, that hée woulde doe off his harneis, and vnarme him, and come
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:7118:271"/>
with them into the hall: but neuer would hee doe it, for their praiers, but deſcended from the Pallace thus armed as he was, and tooke his horſe, and would haue gone to battell. But, at the requeſt of Andromeda, the king Pria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus came running anon, and took him by the bridle, and ſaid to him ſo many thinges of one and other, that hee made him to returne, but in no wiſe hee woulde vnarme him.</p>
                     <p>Among all theſe thinges the battell was mortall of the Greekes and of the Troyans. Diomedes and Troylus iouſted togither, and at the aſſembly they greeued each other and without faile each of them had ſlaine other, if Menelaus had not come and parted them. Then the king Miſeres of Frigie beate Menelaus, and hadde taken him when Eneas came, and troubled them, and woulde haue ſlaine him, but the ſaid Troilus deliuered them, and ſlew many Greekes. Then came the king Thelamon with three thouſand fighting men, and iouſted in his comming againſt Polidamas, and put him to the worſe, and vnhorſed him. But Troylus ſuccoured him, &amp; made him to remount on his horſe: after came Paris and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chilles on the other ſide, that ſmote among the Troians, by ſo great force, with the helpe of his people, that he put them to the flight vnto the citie, and in this chaſe Achil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les ſlewe Margareton one of the baſtardes of the king Priamus.</p>
                     <p>When Hector knewe that Achilles had ſlaine Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reton, he had great ſorrow, and did anon lace on his helm, and went to the battaile, that his father knew not of, and in his comming, hee ſlew two noble dukes Greekes, the duke Coriphus, and the duke Baſtidus, and he thruſted into the greateſt preaſe of the Greekes, and ſlew as many as he could reach, and the Greekes fled afore him, that there was none ſo hardie that durſt abide his ſtrokes: and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="529" facs="tcp:7118:271"/>
him away, had not Hector béene, which deliuered him, and flewe many Gréekes. Then an admirall of Gréece named Leocides, aſſailed Hector, and Hector ſlewe him anon.</p>
                     <p>When Achilles ſaw that Hector ſlewe thus the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of Gréece, and ſo many other, that it was marueile to beholde, he thought that if Hector were not ſlaine, the Gréekes ſhould neuer haue victorie. And foraſmuch as he had ſlaine many kings and princes, he ran vpon him marueilouſly, and a noble duke of Gréece with him na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Polyceus, that was come for the loue of Achilles, the wich had promiſed to giue to him his ſiſter in marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. But Hector ſlew the ſame duke anon in the ſight of Achilles. Then Achilles wéening to auenge the death of Policeus, aſſailed Hector by great ire: but Hector caſt to him a dart fiercely, &amp; made him a wound in his thigh: and then Achilles iſſued out of the battell, and did binde vp his wound, and tooke a great ſpeare in purpoſe to ſtay Hector, if he might meete him. Among all theſe things, Hector had taken a very noble baron of Gréece, that was queintly and richly armed, and for to leade him out of the hoſte at his eaſe, had caſt his ſhielde behinde him at his backe, and had left his breaſt diſcouered: and as hee was in this point, and tooke none heede of Achilles, he came priuily vnto him, and thruſt his ſpeare within his bodie, and Hector fell downe dead to the grounde. When the king Menon ſawe Hector dead, hee aſſailed Achilles by great ire, and beate him downe to the grounde, and hurt him grieuouſly, and his men bare him into his tent vpon their ſhield. Then, for the death of Hector, were al the Troyans diſcomfited, and reentred into their citie, bearing the bodie of Hector with great ſorrow and lamentation.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen Hector was dead, &amp; his body borne into the citie, there is no tongue that could expreſſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſorrow that was made in the citie generally of men and women: and there was none, but he had rather to haue loſt his owne ſonne then him: and they ſayd euery one, that from thencefoorth they had loſt all their hope and truſt of defence: and thus they demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned right long their extreame griefe and ſorrow. The noble kings and princes bare the bodie vnto the pallace of Ilyon. Their when the king Priamus ſaw him, he fell downe in a ſwowne vpon the bodie, and was as dead for ſorrow, that vnneth they coulde take him away by force. There demeaned great ſorrow all his brethren. What might men ſay of the ſorrow that his mother the Queene made, and afterward his ſiſter? O what ſorrowe made his wife? certes there can no man expreſſe al the lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations that there were made. And foraſmuch as the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy might not long endure without corruption, the king Priamus tooke counſell of many wiſe maſters, how they might keepe the bodie of Hector without corruption and without ſepulture: and then hee did cauſe to be made by their aduice and counſell a rich ſepulture vpon foure pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of golde, lift vp on height, vpon the which was made a marueilous rich Tabernacle of golde and of precious ſtones: and on the foure corners of the Tabernacle, were foure images of golde, that hadde ſemblance of angels: and aboue the Tabernacle there was a wonderfull great image of golde, that was made after the ſemblance of
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:7118:272"/>
Hector, and had the viſage turned toward the Greeks, &amp; held a naked ſworde that he menaced the Greekes with: and there was in the middes of the Tabernacle a place voyd, where the maſters ſate, and put the bodie of Hector fleſh and bones cladde in his beſt garments and robes, and ſtood right vp on his feete, and might endure a long time in that wiſe without corruption, by a certaine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice that the maiſters had ſet on the ſommet or toppe of the head of Hector: that is to witte, a veſſell that had an hole in the bottome, which veſſel was all full of very fine balme, and that diſtilled and dropped into a place aboue on his head, and ſo ſpread downe into all the members of the bodie, aſwell within as without, and they filled of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten times the veſſell with balme. And thus the bodie might not impaire for the great vertue of this balme. And all the people that would ſee Hector, they ſawe him verily in like maner as hee had béene aliue. To this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulture, the ſame maiſters made a lampe of fine golde, burning continually without going out or quenching, and afterward they made a cloſure, to the end that no man ſhould approch nor goe vnto this Tabernacle without li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence or leaue. And in this Temple the king Priamus ordeined and ſet great plentie of prieſts for to pray vnto the gods without ceaſing, for his ſonne Hector, and gaue to them good rents.</p>
                     <p>Among theſe things, the king Agamemnon aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled all the kings and moſt nobles of his hoſte, and ſayde vnto them in this maner: My friends all, ye kings, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and barons, wee ought to render and yeeld thanks to the gods humbly and with deuout heart, that our right hard enemie Hector hath ſuffered to be ſlaine by the hand of Achilles. For as long as he was aliue, we had neuer any hope to haue come to the better hand of our enemies. What may the Troyans from hencefoorth hope or truſt for, but onely for their owne ouerthrow? and we may in ſhort time hope for the victorie vpon them. And for as
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:7118:273"/>
much as Achilles is grieuouſly hurt, and may not goe to battell, if ye thinke good, whiles that yee maybe healed, and the other alſo that be hurt (of whom we haue many, and alſo for to burie the dead bodies) we will ſend to the king Priamus for to haue truce for two moneths. The counſell ſeemed good to them, and they ſent anon to the king Priamus for truce, and hee accorded it to them for two moneths.</p>
                     <p>During this truce, Palamedes murmured againe at the ſeignorie of Agamemnon, and as they were on a day all together, &amp; Palamedes ſpake of this matter, the king Agamemnon anſwered to him, as ſage, in the preſence of all the other, and ſayd vnto him: Palamedes, weeneſt thou that I haue great ioy of the ſeignorie that was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto me at the beginning, and haue occupied to this preſent time? for that it was not at my requeſt, neither haue I none auaile nor profit thereby, but I haue great charge, and breake many ſléepes therefore, to the end that by my negligence our hoſte goe not to decline nor diſwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: and certes if had well ſuffiſed me to haue beene vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the gouernment of another: and I feare no man that may accuſe mee, that for any euill or negligence I haue failed in any thing. And if thou gaueſt not thy conſent vnto mine election, thou needeſt not to diſmay thereof: for thou wereſt not as yet at that time come with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but it was two yeeres after ere thou cameſt. And therefore, if wee ſhoulde haue abiden thy comming, wee had beene at the Port of Athens. And foraſmuch as thou ſhalt not thinke that I haue ioy or pleaſure of this office, and am deſirous to haue this honour, I am content that another be choſen, and am readie to giue conſent with the moſt voices. When Agamemnon had thus ſpoken, there was no further procéeding that day in this matter. And then at euen Agamemnon did make it to bee cried in all the hoſte, that ech man ſhould be on the morrow betimes before his tent at the Parlement.</p>

Deyphebus was the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, and then Parie: and after him came the king Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amus, and Troylus, Eneas, Menon and Polidamas, they went vnto the Tentes of the Greekes. Palamedes had ordained his battailes. Then began the battel great and mortall. The king Priamus ſmote downe Palame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des in his comming, and after ſmote vnto the greateſt preaſe of the Greekes, and ſlew many of them, and beat them downe, and did ſo much in armes in that day, that with great paine woulde beleeue that a man ſo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and old might doe that he did that day. The king Sarpedon of Troy aſſailed king Neoptolemus, that was a paſſing ſtrong knight, and king Sarpedon was borne to the earth, that defended him valiantly, and gaue ſo great a ſtroke vnto king Neoptolemus, that made him a great wound in his thigh. Then came to the battaile the king of Perſe, that remounted the king Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedon with the aide of his folke. Menelaus and the duke of Athens aſſailed the king of Perſe, and incloſed him and his people among them, and ſlew the king of Perſe, and made the Troyans to recule by force: there did the king Sarpedon, great and woonderous matters of armes.</p>
                     <p>The king Priamus and his baſtard ſonnes that then followed him, ceaſed not to ſlea the Greekes: and there was none that day, that did ſo much in armes, as did the king Priamus, for his ſorrow &amp; his ire made his ſtrength to grow. Then the Greekes aduiſed them to take the way, by which the Troyans ſhould returne vnto their ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: and they went thither in great number. And when the Troyans reculed for to go into that place, they found themſelues in the middle of their enemies. Then began mortall battel and there came vpon them the king Pria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:7118:274"/>
with a great number of fighting men, by a wing, and Paris came croſſing them with a great plentie of good fighters, and he had great ſtore of archers that ſlew many of the Greekes, and hurted them: and they did ſo well, that by force the Greekes were driuen to recule to their Tentes. And the Troyans reentered into their Citie, and the king Priamus had the loſſe and worſt of this battaile. He ſent to the Greekes to demaund truce, and they agreed and accorded to him: but we finde not howe long this truce endured, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Among theſe thinges the king Priamus did cauſe to cary by land, the body of the king of Perſe, for to be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in his countrey: then was the weeping and ſorrow great in Troy, and in eſpeciall of Paris, that loued him exceedingly. During this truce, the anniuerſary of Hec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor approched, when men ſhould mourn fifteene daies in great ſorrow, and after ſhoulde hallow the great feaſt of the funerall, as it was that time the guiſe and cuſtome for kinges and Princes. And then during the truce, the Greekes went and came into the Citie ſafely: and ſo did the Troyans vnto the Tentes of the Greekes. Then Achilles had deſire to go to Troy to ſee the Citie and the feaſt of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> anniuerſary of Hector, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had ſlaine: and ſo he went all vnarmed vnto the temple of Apollo, where as was the ſepulture of Hector, and he found there great plentie of men and women, that were noble and wept, &amp; made great ſorow before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſepulture: which Hector a man might ſee on all ſides al whole, in like maner as he was firſt, by the vertue of that balme. There was the queene Hecuba, and Polixena her daughter, that was paſſing faire, with a great company of noble Ladies, that had all their haire diſperſed and hanging about their ſhoulders, and made right maruellous ſorrow. And albeit that Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixena made ſo great ſorrowe, yet ſhe loſt nothing of her bewtie, but ſeemed, &amp; ſhewed her ſelfe ſo faire in all her members, that nature formed neuer none more fairer, &amp;c</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="538" facs="tcp:7118:275"/>When Achilles had well aduiſed and ſeen Polixena, he ſaid in himſelfe, that hee had neuer ſeen ſo faire a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nor better formed nor made, &amp; with that ſhe was one of the moſt noble women of the world. Then was Achil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les ſhot with the dart of loue, that ſtroke him to the heart ſo maruellouſly that he could not ceaſe to behold her: and the more he beheld her, the more he deſired her. He was ſo beſotted on her, that he thought on no other thing, but abode in the temple vnto the euening, as long as the queene was there: and when ſhe went out, he conueied his eye vpon Polixena, as farre as he might ſee her: and this was the cauſe, and the beginning of his miſhappe. In this ſorrow Achilles returned vnto his tent, and when he was laid to ſleepe, that night there came many things in his minde &amp; in his thought: and he knew then the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that Polixena had put him in, and thought in himſelf that the moſt ſtrong men of the world could not, nor hadde not power to vanquiſh him, but the only regard and ſight of a fraile maide had vanquiſhed and ouercome him: and him ſéemed, that there is no medicine in the world might heale him ſaue ſhe.</p>
                     <p>Then he ſaid my praier, my ſtrength, nor my riches may nothing mooue her to haue pitie on me: I wot ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer what diuell hath put mee in this daunger to loue her that hateth me ſo ſore, with mortall hate, and by right good cauſe, for I am come hither for to ſlea her kinne and coſins, and now late haue ſlaine her noble brother Hector. Certes I ſee no remedie, ſince ſhee is the moſt noble and faireſt of the world. And then he turned him to the wall, and fell in weeping, and drowned himſelfe in teares, and of neceſſitie he muſt thinke how he might come to the loue of Polixene: and ſo he couered and hid his courage as well as hée might.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XX. ¶How Achilles ſent his ſecret meſſenger vnto Hecuba the queene of Troy, for to requeſt her daughter Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixena, and of the anſwere: and how for the loue of her the ſaid Achilles aſſembled the hoſte of the Greeks, and counſelled them to depart, and haue peace with the Troyans.</head>
                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He night following; as Achilles was laide on his bed, and might not ſleepe, he thought that he would ſend betimes his meſſenger vnto the quéene Hecuba, for to know if hee might finde with her that fauor that ſhe would giue to him her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Polixena to wife, and hee would doe ſo much for her that he would make the Greekes to raiſed th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ge, and go againe into their countrey haſtily, and that peace ſhould be made betweene them. Thus as hee thought in the night, he put in execution and ſo ſent his true meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger vnto the queene, for to require her daughter, and ſaid to her the promiſes that his Lord had commaunded him. When the queene had vnderſtood the wordes of the meſſenger, ſhe anſwered him diſcreetly, notwithſtanding that ſhe hated Achilles more then any man of the worlde, ſaying: friend, as much as in me is, I am ready for to doe that thing that thy maiſter requireth of mée: but ſo ſay vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, that I may not doe this thing alone by myſelfe, but I will ſpeake to my Lord, and to Paris my ſonne, and thou ſhalt come to mee the third day againe, and I will ſay to thée thine anſwere.</p>
                     <p>When the meſſenger heard the quéene ſo ſpeake, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned vnto his Lord, and ſaide to him all that he hadde found: and thus began Achilles to haue hope to come to his intent. The queene Hecuba went anon vnto the king Priamus her huſband, whereas Paris was, and tolde to
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:7118:276"/>
them all that Achilles had ſent to her, and then the king hanged downe his head, and was ſo a long while with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſaying of any word, and after ſaid to his wife: O how is it, as mee thinketh, a hard thing to receiue into friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and amitie, him y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hath done to me ſo great offence, that hath taken away the light of mine eies, in ſlaying my deere ſonne Hector, and hath therein giuen hope to the Greekes to haue the victorie. But yet for to eſchew the more great peril, to the end that mine other ſonnes looſe not their liues, and that I may haue reſt in mine olde daies, I conſent with you that he haue that he requireth: alway foreſeene, that hee doe firſt that thing that he hath promiſed, without any deception. Paris a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to this thing readily, foraſmuch as in the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Achilles was nothing ſpoken of Queene Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lene, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>At the third day after, Achilles ſent againe his meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger vnto the queene, and as ſoone as hee came before her, ſhe ſaid to him: I haue ſpoken to my huſband, and alſo to my ſonne Paris of the requeſt, and alſo of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of thy Lord: and they be content that this his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>requeſt be agreed to him: ſo as, that he do firſt that thing that hee hath promiſed: and ſo thou maieſt ſay to him, that hee may come to the chiefe and end of his deſire, if that he conduct wiſely and ſecretly this thing aſmuch as in him is. The meſſenger tooke leaue of the queene, and came anon to his maiſter, and counted to him al that the quéene had ſaid to him. Then beganne Achilles greatly to thinke how he might performe this that he had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the king Priamus, and that it was a greeuous thing to doe, and that it was not all in his power. But it is a proper vice vnto the fooliſh louers, to promiſe things that are hard to bring about and difficile, for to come to the effect of their loues. And likewiſe glorified him A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chilles, that for his merites or for giuing his aide to the Greekes he would make them to leaue their ſiege. And
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:7118:276"/>
then Achilles by the counſell of Palamedes aſſembled all the kinges and noble men of the hoſte, in parliament, and ſaid to them in this maner.</p>
                     <p>My friendes, that be here aſſembled, for to bring this warre to the end, thinke yee not other while on your ſelues, how by great raſhneſſe, lightneſſe, and folly, and for to recouer the wife of Menelaus, we haue left our countreies and landes, our wiues and our children, and be come into this ſo ſtraunge land, where wee haue diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended the houres fooliſhly, and put our bodies in daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of death, and in great infinite labour: and ſince wee haue been come hither, there be right many kinges and princes dead, and I my ſelf haue ſhed much of my bloud, that neuer ſhould haue happened if wee had not begunne this folly. Helene is nothing of ſo great price that there behooueth to die for her ſo many noble men: there bee enough in the worlde of as noble and as faire women as ſhe is, of whom Menelaus might haue one or two, if hée would. And it is not a light thing to ouercome the Troy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, as they that haue a ſtrong Citie and well furniſhed with good fighters, on horſe back and a foot: and it ought to ſuffiſe to vs that we haue nowe ſlaine Hector and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other of their nobles, by the which we might now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne with our honour and worſhip: and, if wee leaue Helene, haue not we Exione, to whome Helene may not compare in nobleneſſe?</p>
                     <p>Then aroſe the duke of Athens, and the king Thoas, and contraried ſtrongly the wordes of Achilles: and ſo did all the other, and ſaid, that hee ſpake neither reaſon, nor well. Whereat Achilles had great ſorrow, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded his Mirmydones that they ſhoulde not arme them any more againſt the Troyans, &amp; that they ſhoulde giue no counſalle nor aide vnto the Greeks. Among theſe thinges, vittailes beganne to faile among the Gréekes, and they had great famine. Then aſſembled Palamedes al the moſt noble of the hoſte to counſell, and by their
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:7118:277"/>
counſell was the king Agamemnon ſent vnto the City of Meſſe, to the king Thelephus, that charged and laded his ſhippes with vittaile, and came ſafely againe into the hoſte of the Greekes, where he was receiued with great ioy. Among theſe thinges Palamedes did cauſe their ſhippes to be repaired, to the end that they might be more readie, if they had need, &amp;c.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XXI. ¶Of the death of Deyphebus the ſonne of king Priamus: and how Paris ſlew Palamedes: and how the Troyans draue backe the Greekes into their tentes, and ſet fire on their ſhippes: and how for all theſe thinges Achilles would not go to battaile, for the loue of Polixene.</head>
                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen the truce were paſſed, they began to fight as they had been accuſtomed. Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phebus aſſailed in his comming the king Creſſus of Greece, and hee addreſſed to him gladly, and iouſted the one againſt the other: but Deyphebus beate the king Creſſus dead downe to the ground, whereat the Greekes were ſore troubled, and put them to flight. But Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes and Diomedes came with fiue and twentie thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand fighting men, that reſiſted the Troyans: with them was the noble king Thelamon Ayax, that addreſſed him againſt Eufronius, one of the baſtard ſonnes of the king Priamus, &amp; ſmote him ſo hard that he beate him downe dead to the ground, in ſight of Deiphebus, that in his great furie ranne vpon Thelamon, and beate him and ſore hurt him. When Palamedes ſawe the ſtroke, hee tooke a great ſpeare, and addreſſed him to Deyphebus, and ſmote him ſo hard in the breſt, that the ſpeare entered into his body, and the ſpeare brake and the truncheon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:7118:277"/>
in the body of Deyphebus. When Paris ſawe his brother ſo hurt to the death, hee tooke him, and lead him vnto the gate of the Citie, and tooke him to his men to keepe. And as Deyphebus opened his eyes and ſaw Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris his brother, he ſaid to him: Brother wilt thou let me deſcend into hell without auenging of my death: I pray thee as earneſtly as I may, that ere this truncheon bee taken out of my body, thou doe ſo much by thy hand, that thou ſlay him that hath ſlaine me. Paris promiſed him, that he would doe his beſt: and returned into the battell right angry for his brother, and ſayd in himſelfe that hee deſired no longer to liue, but vntill hee had auenged the death of his brother: and ſought Palamedes all abouts, and found him, that he fought againſt the king Sarpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, that had aſſaied for to ſlay him, and Palamedes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended himſelfe valiantly, and in his great fury gaue ſo great a ſtroke with his ſworde to the king Sarpedon, that he cut off his ſhoulder from the body, and anon king Sarpedon fell downe dead.</p>
                     <p>Paris ſéeing the great damage that Palamedes did to them, and how with his proweſſe he had put the Troi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to flight, and ceaſed not to ſlay and ſmite downe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: he bent his ſtrong bowe, and aymed well at Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes at leaſure, and ſhot to him an arrow enuenimed, and ſmote him in the throat, and cut in two the maiſter veine, and Palamedes fell downe dead to the earth: for whoſe death the Gréekes made much ſorrow, and left the battell, and went vnto their tents, and there held a parle againſt the Troyans, and defended them ſtrongly. Then deſcended the Troyans afoote, and entred into ſome of their tents, and tooke all that they found that good was; Then Paris and Troylus went by a ſide way vnto the Port, and did put fire into their ſhips, and burnt ſo great plentie, that men might ſée the flame farre. To the reſcue of the ſhips came the king Thelamon, with a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of fighting men, and beganne the battell horible, ſo
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:7118:278"/>
ſo that there was great killing &amp; ſlaughter on both ſides: and verely the ſhips had beene all burnt, had it not beene for the proweſſe of king Thelamon, that did marueiles with his bodie, &amp; for whatſoeuer he did, there were more then fiue hundred ſhips burnt. There was great ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Greeks, &amp; many were hurt. There was Ebes the ſonne of the king of Trace ſore hurt with a ſpeare, and bare the truncheon in his bodie, &amp; in that point he went to the Tent of Achilles, where hee reſted him that day, and had refuſed to goe to the battell, for the loue that hee had to Polixene. Ebes reproched greatly Achilles, that he ſuffered ſo to deſtroy the people of his countrey, and to die villainouſly, and ſaying that he might well helpe them if he would. And aſſoone as he had finiſhed his words, one tooke the truncheon out of his body, and anon he fel down dead in the preſence of Achilles.</p>
                     <p>Anon after, came from the battell one of the varlets or ſeruants of Achilles, and Achilles demaunded him ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of the hoſt. Ha ſir, ſayd he, it is this day miſhapped to our folke, for the great multitude of Troyans that be come vpon them, and they haue ſlaine all that they coulde <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>éet with, and I trow there is not left one at home of the men of Troy but that euery man is come to the battell: and therefore, if it pleaſe you now, whiles that the Troy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans be wearie, to come to the battell, ye ſhall get to you perpetuall memorie of worſhip and of glorie. For by your proweſſe you ſhal in little ſpace haue all vanquiſhed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and they ſhall not dare to defend themſelues againſt you, they be ſo wearie. Neuer would Achilles for the words of his varlet, nor for the death of Ebes, change his courage, but diſſembled all that he had ſeene &amp; heard, for the great loue that he had to Polixene.</p>
                     <p>During theſe things, the battell was right ſharpe, and endured vnto the night, to the great damage of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gréeks: and the night parted them, yet was not Deiphebus dead, but hee drewe towardes his ende: and when Paris and
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:7118:278"/>
Troylus ſaw him in that ſorrow, they began to cry and make great ſorrow. And then Deyphebus opened a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle his eies, and demaunded of Paris with a féeble voice, if he were dead that had ſlaine him? And Paris ſaide to him yea. Then Deyphebus did cauſe to drawe out the head of the ſpeare with the truncheon, and anon died. Wherefore the Troyans made great ſorrowe. It is no néed to hold long talke of the ſorrow, that the king Pria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus his father made, nor his wife and his ſiſter, for it was too much, and alſo for the death of the king Sarpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. Of the other partie the Greekes made great ſorrow for the death of Palamedes, and made his body to be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried worſhipfully. And as they that might not bee long without an head and gouernour, by the counſell of the duke Neſtor, and of other, Agamemnon was ſet againe in his dignitie as he was before.</p>
                     <p>The day following, the Troyans early in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> morning iſſued out of the citie, in good order: and the Greekes came againſt them. Then began the battell mortall, and there was great ſlaughter on both ſides: but it rained ſo much that day, that the Greekes withdrew them to their Tentes, and the Troyans followed after them: but the raine was ſo great, that they muſt needes leaue the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell and returne to their citie. On the morrow betimes, they began to fight, and flew that day many barons of the Greekes, and fought till the euen: and ſo they fought the ſpace of ſeuen daies continually, where was great ſlaughter of the one and of the other. And foraſmuch as the Greekes might not ſuffer the ſtenche of the dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, they demaunded truce for two monethes, which were graunted to them by king Priamus.</p>
                     <p>During this truce, the king Agamemnon ſent the duke Neſtor, Vliſſes and Diomedes, to ſpeake to Achilles, for to pray him, and will him to come to the hoſte, for to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againſt the Troyans y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſlew them maruellouſly.

                     <p>Sir Vliſſes, ſayde Achilles, if wee be come into this land for theſe cauſes that ye haue declared, wee may ſay that great folly was among vs, that for the wife of one of vs (that is to wit, of ſir Menelaus) ſo many kings and ſo high princes bee put in perill of death. Had it not béene much more wiſedome, for the noble Palamedes to haue abider in peace in his countrey, then for to be ſlain here, and other kings and princes in like maner? Certes, as the moſt great part of the world of noble menne be héere how aſſembled, if they die here, as many be already dead, it muſt needes follow that the countreys ſhall be repleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and gouerned by villaines. Hector, that was ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ſo worthy, is he not dead? in like wiſe I may die ſhortly, that am not ſo ſtrong as he was. And therfore in
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:7118:279"/>
as much as ye require me to goe to battell, ſo much paine and labour looſe yee, for I haue no more intention to put me any more in daunger: and loue better to looſe my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowme then my life: for in the end there is no proweſſe, but it will be forgotten. Neſtor and Diomedes conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded enough to drawe Achilles to their quarrels, but they might neuer induce him to their purpoſe, nor the wordes of Agamemnon neither. And then he ſayd to them, that they ſhoulde make peace with the Troyans, before that they were all ſlaine. &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Then returned theſe thrée princes vnto Agamemnon, and ſayde to him all that they had found in Achilles: and Agamemnon made it to bee knowen to the princes of the hoſt, whom he had aſſembled for this cauſe, and demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of them their aduice. Then ſtood vp Menelaus, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that it would be to vs now great ſhame to ſéeke peace with the Troyans, ſince that Hector and Deiphebus bee dead, and ſlaine, and that by their death, the Troyans re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute them as vanquiſhed: and that without Achilles they ſhoulde well mainteine the warre againſt the Troyans. To that anſwered Vliſſes and Neſtor, and ſayde, that it was not maruell though Menelaus deſired the warre, for affection to recouer his wife, and that Troy was not ſo diſgarniſhed, but that they had a newe Hector, that was Troylus, who was little leſſe ſtrong and woorthy then Hector. And there was alſo another Deiphebus, and that was Paris, whom wee ought to doubt as much as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and therefore they counſelled the peace, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne home againe to Gréece. Then cried the falſe trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour Calcas, which was traitour to the Troyans, and ſayd: Ha, noble men, what thinke yee to doe againſt the commaundement of the gods? haue not they promiſed to you the victory, and will ye now leaue it? Certes, that ſhould be great folly: take againe courage to you, &amp; fight ye againſt the Troyans more ſtrongly then ye haue done before, and ceaſe not til ye haue the victory, that the gods
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:7118:280"/>
haue promiſed to you. And then with the wordes of the ſayd Calcas, the Gréeks tooke heart to them, ſaying vere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they would mainteine the war againſt the Troy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, whether Achilles holpe them or not, and that for him they would not leaue.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen the truce of two moneths was paſſed, they began to fight in battell right ſharpely. There did Troylus marueiles of armes, for to reuenge the death of his brother. Dares ſayeth in his booke, that hee ſlewe that day a thouſand knights, and the Greeks fledde before him, and the battell endured vnto the night that parted them: the day following, the foureteenth battell beganne hard and ſharpe. There did Diomedes marueiles of armes, and ſlew many Troyans, and hurt them, and addreſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe againſt Troylus one time, that ſmote him ſo harde, that he beate him downe to the earth, and ſore hurt him, and reproched him of the loue of Briſeida. Then the Gréeks ranne with great ſtrength, and tooke Diomedes vp, &amp; bare him vpon his ſhield vnto his tent. Menelaus that ſawe Diomedes ſo beaten, adreſſed himſelfe againſt Troylus, but Troylus that had yet his ſpeare whole, ſmote him ſo hard, that hee beate him downe to the earth ſore hurt, and was borne into his tent by his men vppon his ſhield. Then Agame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>non aſſembled all his ſtrength, and thruſt in among the Troyans, and ſlew many, but
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:7118:280"/>
Troylus came againſt him, and ſmote him downe off his horſe: but hee was anon remounted by the helpe of his folke.</p>
                     <p>Thus finiſhed the battell that day, and Agamemnon ſent for to haue truce for ſix moneths: which were agréed and accorded by king Priamus. Howbeit, it ſeemed to ſome of his councell, that he ſhould not grant them for ſo long. Among theſe things, Briſeida againſt the will of her father, went for to ſée Diomedes that lay ſore hurt in his tent, and ſhee knew well that Troylus that was her loue, had ſo hurt him Then returned into her minde ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny purpoſes, and in the end ſhe ſaw that ſhe might neuer recouer Troylus: and therefore aſſoone as Diomedes were whole, ſhe would giue to him her loue without lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger tarrying.</p>
                     <p>Among theſe things the king Agamemnon tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him vnto the tent of Achilles in the company of duke Neſtor, and Achilles receiued them with great ioy, and Agamemnon prayed him that he would come forth to the battell, and ſuffer no more their people thus to be ſlaine, But Achilles woulde neuer ſtirre vp his courage for his words: yet foraſmuch as he loued Agamemnon, he agréed and conſented y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his men ſhould go to battel without him: whereof Agamemnon &amp; Neſtor gaue him great thanks, &amp; after they had thanked him, he returned into their te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts.</p>
                     <p>When the truce were paſſed, Agamemnon ordeined his people to battell, and Achilles ſent to him his Mirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dones clad &amp; marked with a red ſigne, for to be knowen. Then began the battell hard and ſharpe, to the great da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of both partes. There Troylus beate downe the duke of Athens, and ſlew many of the Mirmidones, and hurt, and fought thus till the night parted them. On the morrow betimes, began the battell ſharpe &amp; mortall, the king Philomenus &amp; Polidamas tooke the king Thoas, and had lead him away, had not the Mirmidones reſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him. Then Troylus ſmote in among them, and
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:7118:281"/>
ſlew many and hurt them, but they deliuered to him a great aſſault, and ſlewe his horſe, and woulde haue taken him. Then Paris and his baſtard brethren ſmote in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, and brake their ranks, and put Troylus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine on his horſe: then was there a fierce fight: there ſlew the Mirmidones Emargeron one of the baſtards of king Priamus of Troy, whereof Troylus had great ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and by the ayde of his people ſmote in among them, and ſlewe and hurt many, but they defended themſelues valiantly, and helde together, and Troylus ceaſed not to grieue them, &amp; to enter among them often times. Then came to the battell Agamemnon, Menelaus, Thelamon, Vliſſes and Diomedes, with all their people, and began a hote ſkirmiſh. There the Greekes did make the Troy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to ſuffer much paine, but Troylus ſuccoured them valiantly, and put himſelfe alway where moſt need was, and ſlewe and beat downe all that he founde, and did ſo much by his proweſſe, that the Greekes fledde into their Tents, and Thelamon defended valiantly, &amp; made them to recouer the fielde by his proweſſe. This was the ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth battell, in the which died many knightes of both ſides. Troylus ceaſed not to grieue the Mirmidones, and there was none ſo puiſſaunt, nor ſo ſtrong, that might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure againſt him, and hee did ſo much, that hee put the Gréeks to flight, and tooke an hundred noble men that he brought into the citie.</p>
                     <p>When the battell was finiſhed, againſt the euen the Mirmidones returned vnto the Tent of Achilles, &amp; there was founde many of them hurt, and there were an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of them dead, whereof Achilles had much ſorrowe: and when it was night, he went to bed, and there he had many thoughts, and purpoſed once to go to the battell for to reuenge the death of his men, and another time hee thought on the beautie of Polixene, and thought that if he went, hee ſhould looſe her loue for euer, and that the king Priamus and his wife woulde holde him for a deceiuer,
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:7118:281"/>
for he had promiſed them, that hee would helpe no more the Greekes, and when he ſaid in himſelfe, that hee had ſent his men vnto their aide, and in this thought Achil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les had béen many daies, and that the day came that the ſeuenteenth battaile began beeing verie much horrible, that dured by ſeuen daies continually, wherin were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Greekes ſlaine, Agamemnon required truce: but the Troyans agreed no longer the truce, but till they hadde buried their dead bodies, and when thoſe daies were paſ: ſed, the eighteenth battaile began right aſpire and fiers. Menelaus and Paris iouſted togither, and beate well each other. Polidamas and Vliſſes fought togither a great while, and Meneſteus beate downe Eneas with iouſting. The king Phylomenus beate Agamemnon, and had ſore hurt him, if Thelamon had not come on that ſmote to ground Philomenus ſore wounded. Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logus the ſonne of duke Neſtor, aſſailed one of the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtardes of king Priamus named Brum, and ſmote him ſo hard with his ſpeare, that hee bare him downe to the ground and ſlew him. Whereof the Troyans had great ſorrow, and aboue all other Troylus was angry, that ſmote in among the Greekes and had put them to flight hadde not the Mirmidones haue been that reſiſted him. And therefore Troylus ſmote in among them, and ſlewe ſo many, and beate downe, and did ſo much, that he made the Greekes to go backe into their Tentes, and alighted on foote and entered into the tentes, and ſlewe them on all ſides: and there was ſo great a crie, that the ſounde came to Achilles, that reſted him in his Tent, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded of one of his ſeruauntes that was there, what it was? and he ſaid to him, that the Troyans had vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed the Greekes, and ſlewe them within their Tents, which were no more able to defend them: and thinke ye to be ſure here ſaid he? nay ye ſhall ſee anon more then forty thouſand Troyans that ſhall ſlea you vnarmed: for at this time they haue ſlaine the moſt part of your
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:7118:282"/>
Mirmidones, and they ceaſe not to ſlea them, and there ſhall not abide one aliue, but if they be ſuccoured.</p>
                     <p>At theſe wordes Achilles did quake for yre, and ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde him the loue of Polixene, and did arme him haſtily, and mounted on his horſe, and ranne all out enraged as a Lion, and ſmote in among the Troyans, and ſpoiled the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſlewe and hurt them in ſuch wiſe, that anon his ſworde was knowne, and the bloud ran in the field all about as he went. When Troylus knewe that Achilles fought with his ſword, he addreſſed him to him, and gaue him ſo great a ſtroke, that he made him a great wound and a deepe, that he muſt needes ceaſe many daies of comming to battaile. Troylus was hurt alſo by the hand of Achil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, but nothing ſo ſore, and both fel down to the ground, and the battaile dured vntill the night: and on the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe they beganne again, and endured vnto the Euen. And thus they fought ſixe daies continually: Wherefore there were many ſlaine on either part. The king Pria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus had great ſorrowe of this that Achilles againſt his promiſe was come into the battaile, and thought that he had giuen him to vnderſtand a thing that was not: but rather that hee meant for to deceiue him then otherwiſe, and reproched his wife to beleeue ſo lightly him: and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixene ſorrowed then enough, for ſhe was contented then to haue had Achilles to her huſband.</p>
                     <p>Achilles among other thinges, did heale his woundes, during ſixe monethes of truce that they had gotten, which woundes Troylus had giuen him, and he purpoſed to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge him, and that Troylus ſhould die ſhamefully by his hand. After theſe things the nineteenth battel began with great ſlaughter, and afore that Achilles entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the battaile, he aſſembled his Mirmidones, and praied them that they would intend to none other thing, but to incloſe Troylus, and to hold him without flying till hee came, and that he would not be farre from them. And they promiſed him that they ſo would. And he thronged
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:7118:282"/>
into the battell. And of the other ſide came Troylus, that beganne to ſlea and beate downe al them that he raught, and did ſo much, that about midday he put the Gréeks to flight: then the Mirmidones (that were two thouſand fighting men, and had not forgot the commaundement of their Lord) thruſted in among the Troyans, and recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the field. And as they held them together, and ſought no man but Troylus, they found him, that hee fought ſtrongly, and was incloſed on all partes, but he ſlew and wounded many. And as he was all alone among them, and had no man to ſuccour him, they ſlew his horſe, and hurt him in many places, and plucked off his head his helme, and his coife of yron, and he defended him in the beſt manner he could. Then came on Achilles, when he ſawe Troylus all naked, and ran vpon him in a rage, and ſmote off his head and caſt it vnder the féete of his horſe, and tooke the body and bound it to the taile of his horſe, and ſo drew it after him throughout the hoſt. Oh what villanie was it to drawe ſo the ſonne of ſo noble a king, that was ſo worthy and ſo hardy? Certes, if anie nobleneſſe had béen in Achilles, he would not haue doone this villanie.</p>
                     <p>When Paris knew that Achilles had thus villainou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly ſlaine Troylus, he had great ſorrow, and ſo had Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as and Polidamas, and laboured to recouer his body, but they might not, for the great multitude of Gréekes that reſiſted them. On the other part, the king Menon died of ſorow for the death of Troylus, and aſſailed Achilles, and ſaid vnto him in reproch: Ha, ha, euil traitour, what crueltie hath mooued thée to bind to the taile of thy horſe, the ſonne of ſo noble a Prince as the king Priamus is, and to drawe him as hee were the moſt villaine of the world? Certes thou ſhalt abide it, and ranne vpon him, and ſmote him ſo hard with his ſpeare in his breaſt, that he gaue him a great wound, and after gaue him ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſtrokes with his ſworde, that hée beat him downe
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:7118:283"/>
to the ground, and then was the body of Troylus recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with great paine. The folk of Achilles relieued their Lord and ſet him againe on his horſe: and as ſoone as his ſtrength came to him againe, he came againe into the preaſe, and encountered the king Menon, and aſſailed him ſtoughtly, and the king Menon defended him vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly, and did hurt Achilles in many places: but there came ſo much people on the one ſide and of the other, that they were parted: then came the night on, that parted them, and made them to ceaſe, and they fought thus the ſpace of ſeuen daies.</p>
                     <p>At the ſeuenth day, when Achilles was healed of his woundes, deſiring to auenge him of the king Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, he ſaide to his folke, that if they might encounter him, they ſhould hold him in cloſe, like as they did Troi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus. Then began the battaile right aſpre, Achilles and Menon fought togither, and by great rage beate downe eche other a foote. Then the Mirmidones encloſed him, and tooke him by force, that had no man to ſuccour him. Then Achilles ſeeing the king Menon in this daunger, he ran vpon him, and ſlew him with great torment: but Menon gaue him before many great woundes, whereof he lay long after. Among theſe thinges, Menelaus and Meneſteus with a great companie of kinges and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and many fighting men, thruſted into the throng and put many Troyans to flight, the which entered into their Citie with doing great miſchiefe, foraſmuch as the Gréeks chaſed them ſo nigh that they ſlew and hurt many of them.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Or the death of Troilus the king Pria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus his wife and his children, and all the inhabitantes of the Citie made great ſorrow maruelouſly: and they ſaide all, that ſince they had loſt Hector, Deyphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus and Troylus, they had from thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth no more hope of their life then of their death. The king Priamus demaunded truce, and it was agreed and accorded by the Greekes: during the which they did bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie honourably the body of Troylus and the body of king Menon. The queene might not be appeaſed nor comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the death of her children, and thought in many manner waies howe ſhee might be auenged on Achil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les that thus had ſlaine her ſonnes by cruel tyranny. And finally ſhe called Paris, ſore weeping, and ſaid to him ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly theſe wordes. Right déere ſonne, thou knoweſt how this traitour Achilles hath ſlaine by treaſon thy bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren my children, that were with thee, the ſolace of my life. And foraſmuch as he hath ſo ſlaine them by treaſon. me ſeemeth good, and alſo iuſt and right, that he be ſlaine by treaſon, and I will tell thee how it ſhalbe done. The vnhappy man hath many times required mee to haue to his wife Polixene, and I haue giuen to him good hope thereof. I haue purpoſed to ſend to him my keeper of my ſignet, and bid him come to ſpeake to mee in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Apollo, and I will, right deere ſonne, that thou be there in waite with a good company of knightes, and then when he ſhall be come, that ye run vpon him, &amp; ſlea him,
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:7118:284"/>
that he eſcape not with his life. Paris anſwered, that he would doe this thing in ſuch wiſe as ſhe hadde deuiſed, and thereupon hee aſſembled twenty good knightes in whom he affied him much, and went forth into the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Apollo.</p>
                     <p>Aſſoone as Achilles heard the meſſenger ſpeake, that came from the quéene Hecuba, the foole being euil coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelled, tooke with him the ſonne of duke Neſtor, &amp; they went both vnto the temple of Apollo, and aſſoone as they were come, Paris and his knightes ran vppon him, and Paris caſt at him three dartes, wherewith hee hurt him ſore. Achilles drewe out his ſworde, that had no more ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and wrapped his arme with his mantell, &amp; ſmote in among the knightes right fierſly, and ſlewe ſeuen of them. But in the end the ſon of duke Neſtor Archilogus, &amp; Achilles, were both ſlain within the temple: and forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Paris commanded, that his body ſhould be caſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the houndes, and to the birds: but at the requeſt of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenus, they were put in a place before the temple, for to be kept. And the Troyans had then great ioy, and ſaide they had no care of the Greekes, ne ſet nought by them. When Agamemnon knew therof, he ſent vnto the king Priamus, for to haue the bodies for to burie them. The king Priamus made them to bee deliuered, and were borne downe to their tentes: then aroſe a great ſorrowe among the Greeks, and ſaid that they had all loſt. The duke Neſtor might not be comforted for the death of his ſon, and they made for Achilles a noble ſepulture, which by the conſent of king Priamus was laide within the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, at the entry of the gate of Tymbre.</p>
                     <p>After theſe thinges the king aſſembled to his counſell all the nobles of the hoſte, and ſhewed to them, how for the death of Achilles, the moſt part of them were diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, &amp; diſcouraged from the war, and therefore deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them if it were good to leaue the warre, or to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and hold it. Then was there among them diuers
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:7118:284"/>
opinions, ſome allowed the warre, and the other blamed it, and at laſt they concluded al togither with one accord, to maintain the warre, ſaying, If Achilles were failed, yet for that ſhoulde not faile the promiſes of the Gods. Then ſtood vp Ayax among them, and ſaide, If Achilles bee dead, let vs ſend for his ſonne whom the king Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comedes his graund-ſire nouriſheth, and teacheth the feates of armes: for I trowe that without him wee may haue no victorie of the Troyans. His counſell ſeemed good, and by the agreement and will of euery man, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelaus was choſen to go fetch Neoptolomus ſonne of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chilles that was named otherwiſe Pirrhus.</p>
                     <p>Among theſe thinges, when that truce were failed, the 16. day of Iune, when the daies be at the longeſt of all the yeare, the Troyans beganne the twentith battell againſt the Greekes, that was right ſharpe and hard: this day went Ayax by great folly, to battaile without armes, and bare nothing but his ſword.</p>
                     <p>The Troyans that had loſt their beſt defenders, were not then ſo hardy as they were woont to be, but for to ſaue their liues they fought mightily: Paris with all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Perſe, that were y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beſt archers, ſlew many Gréeks, and the king Philomenus fought ſtrongly, and they of Paphlagony came on, that ſlew many Gréekes, and by force made them to recule. Meneſteus iouſted againſt Polidamas, and beate him right fierſly, and ranne vpon him with his ſworde, and had taken or ſlaine him, had not the king Philomenus deliuered him from his hands. Ayax did this day maruels of armes, thus vnarmed as hee was, and ſlewe manie Troyans, and was not yet hurt. In the end he ſmote in among them of Perſe that Paris lead, and ſlewe many of them, and made them to turne to flight. When Paris ſaw his people thus ſlaine, he ſhotte to Ayax an arrow enuenomed, and raught him betweene the backe and the ſides, &amp; Ayax anon felt that he was hurt to the death, and hée thought that hee would
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:7118:285"/>
not die, till he had auenged him on him that hadde ſlaine him, and did ſo much that hee found Paris, and ſaide to him, thou haſt ſlaine me with thine arrow: but before that I die, I will ſlea thee. And alſo by thee, and for thy cauſe, be many noble men ſlaine. And then he gaue him ſo great a ſtroke, that he cut a two his face ſo deepe, that he fell downe dead to the earth: and Ayax fell downe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him. The Troyans tooke the body of Paris with weeping teares, and bare it vnto the Citie, and they were followed vnto the gates. The next night follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Agamemnon made the hoſte to approch neere to the Citie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and there pight their Tents. And the Troyans kept their walles day and night. Then hadde the Troy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans no more no hope of their liues, when they ſawe that all the ſonnes of king Priamus were dead: and there is no tongue that can expreſſe the lamentations that the king Priamus made, and his wife and his daughters, and the queene Helene, for the death of Paris: and aboue all other, Helene made the moſt greateſt ſorrow. The king did burie Paris in a right rich ſepulture, and ſet it in the Temple of Iuno honourably, &amp;c.</p>

But the king Priamus fearing and greatly doubting his

Amazonne is a prouince, where dwelled then none but women without men, and they were brought vp to war and to fight. They had nigh their countrey an iſle, where the men dwelled, and they were accuſtomed three times a yeare to go thither, in Aprill, May, and Iune, vnto the men, for to haue their companie, and after they returned into Amazonne, and they that had conceiued, and were with childe, if they bare ſonnes, they gaue them ſucke a certaine time, and after ſent them to the fathers.

When ſhe knew that the Greekes hadde aſſailed Troy with ſo great ſtrength, ſhee went thither, for to ſuccour it with a thouſand virgines, for the loue of Hector. And when ſhe was come, and knewe that he was dead, ſhee made great ſorrow, and praied to the king Priamus that hee woulde let her iſſue out to the battaile againſt the Greekes, and that ſhe might ſhew to them how her mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens could beare their armes.</p>
                     <p>At the praier of Pentheſilea on the morrowe betimes was the gate opened, and there iſſued out the king Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemenus, with al them of Paphlagone, Eneas and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidamas with all their people, the queene Pentheſilea with all her maidens. The Greekes were anon readie and beganne the battaile hard and ſharpe. Mene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteus addreſſed him to Pentheſilea, and ſhee likewiſe to him:: and anon ſhee ſmote Meneſteus downe to the ground, and took his horſe, and gaue him to one of her maidens. Then came Diomedes againſt her, and
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:7118:286"/>
ſhe receiued him gladly, and ſmote him ſtrongly that he was turned vpſide-downe from his horſe, and ſhe tooke from Dyomedes his ſhield trom his neck, and deliuered it to one of her maidens. When Thelamon ſaw that ſhée did ſuch deedes of armes, hee addreſſed him againſt her, and ſhe againſt him, and Thelamon was borne down to the ground, and had lead him into the citie, but Dyome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des came to his reſkewe, with great defence: and then ſhe cried to her maidens, that ſmote in among y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gréeks, by ſuch fierceneſſe and yre, that ſhe and they turned the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to flight, and they chaſed them ſleaing and beating them vnto their tentes, and had ſlaine them all, if Dyomedes had not ſo greatly reſiſted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who maintained the ſkir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh vnto the night, that departed them, and the queene Pentheſilea returned into the citie with great glorie: where the king Priamus receiued her with great ioy, &amp; gaue her many faire Iewels and riche, and him ſeemed well that he ſhould auenge him of his ſorrowes. They fought thus many times after, and ſo long that Mene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus returned from the king Nicomedes, and brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hoſte Neoptolemus the ſonne of Achilles otherwiſe named Pirrhus.</p>
                     <p>This Pirrhus was receiued with great glory of al the barons of the hoſte, and aboue all other, the Mirmidones were paſſing ioyous, and held him for their Lord. Then was deliuered to Pirrhus all the conduct of the men of armes, and they made him knight by the hand of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Thelamon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> praied to the Gods to giue him ſtrength and courage in guiding of his ſword, and that they would giue him victory and honour for to auenge the death of his father: and two other Princes ſette on the ſpurres of gold, and the king Agamemnon gaue to him al the arms of Achilles his father, and all his other pretious pearles and iewels: and for this new knight &amp; feaſt of chiualrie, the Greekes made many daies great gladneſſe &amp; ioy, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>After theſe thinges came the day of fighting, and the
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:7118:286"/>
battels were ready on the one ſide, &amp; on the other. Then began the battaile right hard, Pirrhus that was armed with the proper armes of his father, encountered Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damas in his comming, &amp; had ſlaine him with the great ſtrokes of his ſword that he gaue to him, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomenus came and deliuered him: and then Pirrhus ſmote from his horſe Philomenus, and had lead him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, hadde not they of Paphlagone reſkewed him with great trauell. Among theſe things, the queene Penthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilea entered into the battaile with her maidens, &amp; ſmote in among the Mirmidones, and ſlew many of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. There came then the king Thelamon, that ſmote to the ground Pentheſilea, and ſhe gaue him ſo great a ſtroke with her ſword, that ſhe beate him downe to the earth in like ſorte: and then her maidens relieued her, and ſet her again on horſe, and ſhe ſmote in among the Mirmidones, that held y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king Philomenus in great danger, and many ſhe ſlew and hurt of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. When Pirrhus ſawe that his men were ſo euill intreated, he cried to them and ſaide, that they ought to haue great ſhame that ſuffered them to bee van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed by women: and then he left the king Philome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, for to defend his men againſt the maide. Then ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed the queene Pentheſilea nigh to Pirrhus, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proched him for that his father had ſlaine Hector by trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and that all the world ought to run vpon him. Pir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhus that had ſo great ſorrowe at theſe wordes, addreſſed him againſt her, and anon ſhee beate him downe to the earth: and forthwith hee roſe againe, and aſſailed Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſilea with his ſworde, and ſhe him by great ſtrength: and then was Pirrhus remounted by the aide of his Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midones. Then came to the battaile Agamemnon, Dyo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes, Menelaus, &amp; Meneſteus the duke of Athens, with al their people, and ſo did all the other princes &amp; barons.</p>
                     <p>Among theſe thinges, the king Philomenus was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered of the Mirmidones, and he gaue great thankes vnto the queene Pentheſilea, and ſaid, that had not ſhee
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:7118:287"/>
haue been, he had been ſlaine. Then came to the battell all the Troyans: and ſo began the ſkirmiſh ſharpe and mortall: there encountered Pirrhus Glaucon the ſonne of Anthenor, and brother of Polidamas of another mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and gaue him ſo great a ſtroke, that he ſlew him and fell downe dead to the earth. Then addreſſed Pentheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lea vnto Pirrhus, and hee to her, and beate downe each other to the earth: but they remounted anon, and began the fight togither againe: Then came ſo much people of both partes, that they were parted. Polidamas (for to auenge the death of his brother) ſlewe that day manie, Greekes, and hurt them, and did ſo much in armes hee and Pentheſilea, that they put the Greekes to flight. Then came to the reſkew Pirrhus, Diomedes and The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamon, and made them that fled, to abide and ſuſtaine the combate: and ſo they did vnto the night, that each man went into his place: they fought thus euery day a moneth long, in which time were ſlaine more then ten thouſand fighting men of both parties, and Pentheſilea loſt many of her maidens: and when they had reſted a moneth, they began the battell right ſharpe.</p>
                     <p>At this aſſembly came one againſt another of Pirrhus and Pentheſilea, and brake their ſpears without falling, but Pirrhus was ſo hurt, that the truncheon of her ſpeare abode within his bodie: wherefore the crie aroſe greatly among the Greekes, and they ranne vpon Pentheſilea with great ſtrength, and brake the laſe of her helme: and then Pirrhus that in his great furie tooke none heede to his wound, ſet not thereby that hee had the truncheon in his body, but aſſailed ſtrongly Pentheſilea, that had then her helme broken, and ſhee weend to haue ſmitten him, but Pirrhus raught her firſt, &amp; gaue her ſo great a ſtroke with his ſworde, that hee cutte her arme off by the body, whereof the ſaide Pentheſilea fell downe dead, to the earth: and Pirrhus that was not yet content, ſmote the body, and cut it in two peeces: and anon for the great
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:7118:287"/>
effuſion of bloud that ran from his wound, he fell downe as dead among his people, and they tooke him vp &amp; layed him vpon his ſhield, and bare him into his tent. Then the maidens of Pentheſilea, for to reuenge the death of their Quéene, ſmote in among the Mirmidones by great furie, and ſlew many, and hurt: but it profited but little to the Troyans, as they that were but a few againſt a great multitude of Gréeks. And ſo there were ſlaine of them of Troy that day in the battell, more then tenne thouſande men, and the other withdrewe themſelues into the citie, for to ſaue themſelues, and ſhut &amp; cloſed faſt their gates, and had no more intention to iſſue out to battell againſt their enemies, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Troyans had very great ſorrowe, when they ſawe them in this diſtreſſe, for they had no more hope to haue any ſuccours from any place, and they endeuoured to nothing, but to keepe well their citie, and to furniſh them well with bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile: for they feared nor dreaded nought of any aſſault. Among theſe things, the Gréeks would haue caſt to the dogs the bodie of Pentheſilea, foraſmuch as ſhe had ſlaine ſo many noble men of Gréece: but Pirrus gainſayde it, for the honour and credit of nobleneſſe: and finally, they concluded, that they would caſt it in a pond that was nie the citie. Anchiſes with his ſonne Eneas, and Anthenor with his ſonne Polidamas, went to counſell together, for to aduiſe them, how they might haue their liues ſaued
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:7118:288"/>
againſt the Gréekes, and their goodes, and rather than they woulde faile heereof, they woulde betray the Citie.</p>
                     <p>Then they concluded that they ſhoulde ſpeake vnto king Priamus, and counſell him to take a peace and appointment with the Gréekes, in reſtoring of Helene to her huſband, and the damages that Paris did in the Ile of Citharis. O if the king Priamus had beene ſo happy to haue doone this, and had pleaſed the Gréekes at the beginning, he had ſaued his life, and his wifes life, and the life of all his children, and had ſaued all the Citie and the cittizens, and had eſchewed all the miſchiefes that came to them afterward. Therefore ſay men in a Prouerb, that the concorde or peace ſoone taken is good, for it is an hard thing to reappeaſe ſuch manner damma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to him that hath aduantage of the warre. For with great paine would the Gréekes haue beene content (that were the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at the better hand) with theſe offers, foraſmuch as they had ſuffered ſo many hurtes and damages before Troy, for them ſéemed well that they were at the point for to deſtroy the Citie, and all the inhabitantes. But the aforenamed traitours ſpake not of this matter, but to the end that vnder colour of peace they might betray the citie, if otherwiſe, they might not ſaue their liues.</p>
                     <p>Then they went before the king Priamus and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phimacus one of his baſtard ſonnes, and ſpake there of this matter before many noble men of the Citie: and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue as king Priamus had heard them ſpeake of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing of peace with the Gréekes, he thought that they ſpake this thing by great fury, and beganne to laugh, ſaying to them, that he would be aduiſed and take coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell firſt: and then they ſpake vnto him in this manner: If thou wilt heare our counſell vpon this thing, marke what we ſhall ſay, and if it pleaſe thée not vſe the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of other. The king ſaide that hee woulde well heare their counſell, and would wéete what ſéemed them good, ſaying vnto them: What ſéemeth you good? Then ſpake
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:7118:288"/>
Anthenor ſaying: King, you may not diſſemble but that you and yours be compaſſed with your ennemies, who béene héere by your citie, deſiring your death and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and ye may not iſſue out: there are more than fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie kings that deſire nothing but to deſtroy this Cittie, and you, and all them that dwell therein: yée may no longer reſiſt them, neyther dare ye no more open your gates: and thus we let vs then be incloſed héerein. We ought of two euill things chooſe the leſſe euill: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for to haue peace with the Gréekes, if ye ſéeme good, we will render Helene to Menelaus her huſband, ſince that Paris is dead, and alſo reſtore the damage that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris did doe to them in Gréece, rather than we will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer our ſelues to be put to the death, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>At theſe wordes aroſe vp Amphymacus, one of the baſtard ſonnes of king Priamus, and reprooued egerly the wordes of Anthenor, and ſaide vnto him, what truſt or hope may my Lorde my father and wée haue in thée, ſince that thou oughteſt to haue firme goodwill vnto him and to this citie, and we ſée that thus recreant, thou oughteſt to liue and die with vs, and thou counſelleſt vs now to make peace with the Gréekes to our great diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and ſhame. Truely, before that the king ſhall doe that, there ſhall die twenty thouſand menne: the thing that thou counſelleſt the king, commeth of treaſon. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other iniurious wordes ſaid Amphimacus to Anthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor: and Eneas beganne to interrupt him, ſaying, Yée know well that we may not from hencefoorth goe to bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell againſt the Gréekes, and we dare no more open our gates, wherefore it behoueth vs to finde meanes to haue peace with them. Then the king Priamus with great ire ſaide to Anthenor and to Eneas: haue yée not ſhame in your ſelues to ſpeake ſo to mée? Yée make me die with ſorrow: for all that I haue done hitherto, I haue done it by your counſel. Anthenor, at thy return fro Gréece, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I ſent thée to require my ſiſter, counſelledſt thou not
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:7118:289"/>
me that I ſhoulde ſend Paris into Gréece for to endam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage the Greekes? And I had neuer taken vpon me for to haue mooued war againſt them, had not thy falſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell beene, which moued me to ſend thither. And thou E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas, alas when I ſent thee with Paris into Greece, waſt not thou principall of the counſell that Paris ſhould rauiſh Helene, and bring her into this realme, and thou helpedſt thereto with thy perſon? And if thou wouldeſt haue béene contrary thereto, and haue let it, Helene had neuer ſeene the walles of Troy. And now after this, that they haue ſlaine all my children, and done ſo much dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and hurt, ye counſell mee, againſt honour, to make peace with the Gréeks, that haue ſo cruelly deſtroyed me? Certes, your counſell finiſheth my life with great ſorow and diſhonour, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Of theſe wordes was Eneas exceedingly angrie and wroth, and anſwered to the king wordes ſharpe and pric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king enough, and departed, he &amp; Anthenor from the king euill content. And when they were gone, the king began to weepe, as hee that dreaded that they would deliuer the citie into the hands of the Greeks, which would ſlay him incontinent. Then he thought that he would make them die firſt, and called to him Amphimacus, and ſayd to him: Right deare ſonne, I am thy father, we ought to ſupport ech other, vnto the death. I know certeinly, that Anthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and Eneas contend for to ſlay vs by the Gréekes, and to deliuer them this citie: and therefore it ſhould not be ill done to make them fall into the pitte that they haue made ready before ere they doe any ſuch euill, and I will tell thee in what maner. To morrow at euen they will come to take counſell, then thou ſhalt be ambuſhed here within, and thou ſhalt haue with thee good knights, and when they ſhall bee come, thou ſhalt runne vppon them, and ſlay them. Amphimacus made anſwere vnto him, and ſayd, that hee would ſo doe with a verie good will, and albeit there were no more aſſembled at this counſell
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:7118:289"/>
but the king and his ſonne: yet there is nothing ſo ſecret but otherwhile it is knowne. Eneas knew wel the truth of this thing, and it was not knowne by whom he knew it, and anon hee and Anthenor and ſome other of their complices, ſpake forth of the treaſon of the citie, and there they ſwore each to other: and then they ſaid, if they went more to counſaile to the king, that they woulde go with great company of men of armes: for Eneas was of the moſt noble of Troy, and moſt rich next to the king, and beſt of linage, and might well compare to the king. And Anthenor was alſo rich and puiſſant of friendes in the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and their treaſon was ſuch that they would haue deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered the city in the handes of their enemies: So as they and all they of their linage ſhoulde haue their liues and their goods ſaued, and thereof they tooke good ſuretie of the Greekes.</p>
                     <p>Among theſe thinges the king Priamus ſent for An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenor, and Eneas to come to counſell, for to performe that thing that he hadde purpoſed, but they came with a great company of men of armes: and therefore the king ſent Amphymacus that hee ſhoulde leaue off this enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe. The day following, the king ſent for all the Troi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to councel, and when they were aſſembled before him, Eneas ſtood vp and willed all them to make peace with the Greekes: to whom all the other accorded ſaue the king, and then ſaid to him Eneas, Sir king, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conſenteſt not thou with the other, for will thou or will thou not, we will treate for the peace, and wil make it maugre thee. When the king ſawe that his contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction might nothing auaile, he had leauer conſent with the other, then for to be the cauſe of his deſtruction, and then ſaid he to Eneas, Let it be made as ye ſhall thinke that it may bee moſt expedient to the peace, and I will thinke wel of it. Then by the counſel of them all, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenor was choſen for to go to the Greekes, and treat for the peace: and the Troyans tooke branches of Palme in
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:7118:290"/>
ſigne of peace, and went vppon the walles of the Citie, and ſhewed the ſigne vnto the Gréeks, the which ſhewed well that they would entend to the peace. And then was Anthenor retyred from the walles and let downe, and was preſented to the king Agamemnon. And the king A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamemnon commiſed all the work to the king of Crete, Diomedes, and Vliſſes, and that all thoſe thinges that theſe thrée kinges ſhould decree with Anthenor, all the Gréeks promiſed to hold it agreeable, and ſware it vpon their law, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>When they were all foure aſſembled, Anthenor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſhed with furie, promiſed to them to deliuer the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie by treaſon, for to doe with it their will and pleaſure, ſo that they woulde ſaue him and Eneas and all their kinſmen and parentage, and all them that they woulde chooſe, and that Eneas ſhould haue all his poſſeſſions without any loſſe. Theſe three kings of Greece ſwore to Anthenor that thus they would do, and hold: then ſaid one to the other that this thing muſt be ſecret, vnto the time it be brought about, and to the end to keepe this treaſon more ſecret, Anthenor praied to the Greekes, that they would deliuer to him the king Caſſilius that was a very auncient man, for to go with him to Troy, to the intent that he might be the better beleued, and for that he knew the will of the Troians, that is to weet, if they woulde haue peace with the Greekes, and alſo for to ſay to them the will and deſire of the Greekes, and then demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Anthenor the body of Pentheſilea, which the Gréeks agreed to them gladly.</p>
                     <p>After theſe thinges Anthenor and the king Caſſilius entred into the citie, and did to be knowne to the king their comming. On the morrow betimes, the king Pria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus aſſembled al the Troians, for to heare the anſwer of Anthenor: the which ſaide to the king otherwiſe then hée founde, making a long ſermon, for to couer his badde doing.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="567" facs="tcp:7118:290"/>Where he ſpake long of the puiſſance of the Gréeks, and of their truth in their promiſes, and how they had holden the truce that they made, lying before the citie, &amp; had béen faithfully gouerned without breaking of them, and after ſpake he of the feebleneſſe of the Troyans, &amp; of the daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers that they were in: and in this time concluded, that forthwith it were profitable to ſeeke peace, and that they were come thereto: and ſaid, it coulde not be vnleſſe they gaue a great quantity of gold and ſiluer vnto the Greeks for to reſtore to them the great damages that they had in the warre. And after they aduiſed the king &amp; the other, each in himſelf, for to employ him in this thing without any ſparing. And foraſmuch (ſaid Anthenor) as I cannot know at this time al their will, I would that yee would let Eneas go with mee vnto them, for to knowe better their will, and to the end that they beleeue vs the better. Euerie man allowed the words of Anthenor: and then went he and Eneas to the Greeks, and with them the king Caſſilius.</p>
                     <p>When the counſel was finiſhed, and all done, the king Priamus entred into his chamber &amp; began to wéep right gréeuouſly, as he that perceiued wel the treaſon, &amp; play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſore the death of his ſons, and the great damage that he bare, and that worſe is, he muſt buy his peace of them that had done to him al this hurt, and to giue them al the treaſure that he had in long time gathered togither, &amp; to become poore in his olde daies, and yet hee is not ſure of his life, but muſt needs do the will of them that ſhal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray him. On the other ſide when Helene knew that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenor ſhuld go to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gréeks, ſhe praied him right effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly, that he wold make her peace with Menelaus her huſband, and that he would take pitie on her: and he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to her, that he would do to his power.</p>
                     <p>When Eneas and Anthenor were come into the hoſte of the Greekes, they treated of their treaſon, with the three kinges that the Greekes hadde commiſed: and
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:7118:291"/>
there they made the peace for Helen, and tooke good ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. After their communication, the Gréeks ordained that Diomedes and Vlyſſes ſhoulde goe with them to Troy, and they went with them. There was great ioy when they heard of their comming into their Cittie, weening to the Troyans to haue had the peace they had ſo much deſired. On the morrow earely, by the commaundement of the king Priamus, all the Troyans were aſſembled at his pallace, then ſpake Vlyſſes, ſaying vnto them, that the Gréekes demaunded two thinges, that is to wéete, reſtitution of their damages, and great quantitie of gold and ſiluer: and alſo they demaunded that Amphymacus ſhoulde bee baniſhed for euer out of the Cittie of Troy, without any truſt euer to come in againe, (this purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Anthenor for Amphymacus, foraſmuch as he had contraried him afore.) O how great peril it is to ſpeake lightly in time of perturbation and ſedition. Then as they were all aſſembled in parleament, they heard ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainely a maruellous crie: at that Diomedes and Vliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes were in great feare that the people would haue ſlaine them: then the other ſaid that they would take theſe two kings in the ſteade of Amphymacus, to the intent that hee ſhould not be baniſhed: and yet there could no man know nor wéete from whence this noiſe came, nor wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, therefore they departed, and euery man went into his place, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Then Anthenor drew apart Diomedes and Vliſſes for to ſpeake of their euill practiſes. Then ſayd vnto him Vliſſes, Wherefore tarrieſt thou ſo long, and delayeſt to do that thou haſt promiſed? Anthenor anſwered &amp; ſayd: The gods doe know that Eneas and I attend to none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, but to doe that we haue promiſed to you, but there is a marueilous thing that hindreth vs, and I will ſay to you what it is. Certeinely, when the king Ilion founded firſt the pallace of Ilion in this citie, hee eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in the name of Pallas a great temple in this Citie,

and when it was all ready and made, ſauing the tower, a marueilous thing deſcended from the heauen, and that ſtacke in the wall of the temple within the great altar, and it hath bene there till this time, and none may beare it away, ſaue they that keepe it: the matter is of tree or of wood, but there is no man that knoweth of what wood, nor howe it is ſo made: but the goddeſſe Pallas that ſent it thither, gaue vnto this thing a great vertue, that is this, that as long as this ſayde thing ſhall be within the temple or within the citie, within the walles, the Troy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans may not looſe their Citie, nor the kings, nor the heires, and this is the thing that holdeth the Troyans in ſuretie, and therefore they may the better keepe it. And this thing hath to name Palladium, foraſmuch as the goddeſſe Pallas ſent it. Then ſayd Diomedes: If this thing be of ſuch vertue as thou ſayſt, we looſe our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. Then ſayde Anthenor that they ought nothing to diſmay them, for he and Eneas attended for to fulfill the promiſe, for I haue but late ſpoken to the Prieſt that kée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth it, to the end that he may deliuer it by ſtealth: and I haue ſure truſt that he ſhall deliuer it me for a great ſum of golde that I promiſed him: and aſſoone as I ſhal haue it, I will ſend it to you out of the citie: and then we ſhal performe that thing we haue promiſed to you: and ere ye goe hence, for to couer and hide our worke, I will goe vnto the king Priamus, and will let him to vnderſtand, that I haue ſpoke long to you, to knowe what quantitie of golde ye demaunde: and it was ſo effected as Anthenor had determined.</p>

XXVI. ¶Howe the traitour Anthenor bought of the Prieſt the Palladium: and gaue it to Vliſſes: and of the horſe of braſſe that was by the Greekes brought to the temple of Pallas, being full of men of armes: and how the city of Troy was taken, and burnt, and the king Priamus ſlaine, &amp;c.</head>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen Diomedes and Vliſſes were returned into their hoſte, Anthenor went vnto the king Priamus, and ſaid to him that hee ſhould aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble all his folke to counſell: and when they were all come, Anthenor ſaide to them, that for to come to the peace of the Greekes they muſt needes pay twentie thouſand mark of gold, and that in good weight, and aſmuch of ſiluer, and alſo an hundred thouſand quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Wheate: and this muſt be made ready within a certaine time: and then when they haue this, they ſhall giue ſuretie to holde the peace without any fraud or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiltie.</p>
                     <p>There it was ordained how this ſumme ſhould be le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uied: and whiles they were buſie thereaboutes, Anthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor went to the Prieſt that kept the Palladium, the which Prieſt hadde to name Thoant, and bare to him a great quantitie of golde, and there were they two at counſaile. Anthenor ſaide to him, that hee ſhoulde take this ſumme of golde, wherewith he ſhoulde bee rich all his life, and that he ſhoulde giue to him the Palladium, and that no man ſhould knowe thereof, for I haue (ſaide hée) great feare, and as much dread as thou, that anie man ſhould knowe thereof. And I will ſend it to Vliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and hee ſhall beare the blame vppon him, and euerie man ſhall ſay that Vliſſes ſhall haue ſtollen it, and wee ſhalbe quit therof both two, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="571" facs="tcp:7118:292"/>Thoant the prieſt reſiſted long the wordes of Anthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor: but in the end, for couetouſneſſe of the great ſumme of golde that Anthenor gaue vnto him, he conſented that he ſhould take the Palladium and beare it away. Then Anthenor tooke it anone, and ſent it vnto Vlyſſes the ſame night, and after the voyce ranne among the people, that Vlyſſes by his ſuttletie had taken and borne away the Palladium out of Troy. O what treaſon was this of a Prieſt, that loued better for couetouſneſſe to betray his citie than to leaue the golde that was giuen him! Certes, it is a fowle vice in a Prieſt the ſinne of coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe, but few haue béene before this time, and few be yet, but they be attainted therewith, whereof it is great pittie, ſince it is ſo that auarice is the mother of all vices. Whileſt that the Troyans gathered together their gold and ſiluer, and put it in the Temple of Minerua, to kéepe vnto the time that it was all collected, it pleaſed them to offer and make ſacrifice to their god Apollo: and when they had ſlaine many beaſts for their ſacrifice, and had put them vppon the Altare, and had ſet fire vnto them for to burne them, it happened that there came two very ſtraunge maruailes, the firſt was, that the fire woulde not kindle nor burne, for they beganne to make the fire more than tenne times, and alwayes it quenched, and might neuer burne the ſacrifice. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond myracle or maruell was, when they had appointed the entrailes of the beaſts for their ſacrifice, a great Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle deſcended from the ayre, crying greately, and tooke with his féete the ſaide entrailes, and bare them into the ſhippes of the Gréekes.</p>
                     <p>Of theſe two things were the Troyans ſore abaſhed &amp; diſmayed, &amp; ſaid that the gods were wroth with them. Then demaunded they of Caſſandra what theſe thinges ſignified: and ſhée ſaide vnto them, that the god Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo was wroth with them for the effuſion of the bloud of Achilles that was ſhedde, wherewithall his Temple
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:7118:293"/>
was defiled and violated: this is the firſt, and ye muſt goe fetch fire at the ſepulture of Achilles, and light your ſacrifice therewith, then will it quench no more: and they did ſo, and the ſacrifice burnt cleare: and for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond myracle, ſhe ſaid to them, that for certaine, treaſon was made of the Cittie with the Gréekes. When the Gréekes heard of theſe myracles, they demaunded of Calcas what it ſignified, and hee aunſwered that the yéelding of the Cittie ſhoulde come ſhortely. Amongeſt theſe things Calcas and Criſis the Prieſt counſelled the Gréekes, that they ſhould make a great horſe of braſſe, and that muſt be ſo great as might hold within it a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand knights armed: and they ſaide vnto them, that it was the pleaſure of the gods. This horſe was made by a paſſing wiſe maiſter, as Appius was, whoſe name was Sinon, and hee made it ſo ſubtilly, that no man might perceiue nor ſée entrie nor iſſue: but within it was eaſie to them that were cloſed therein for to iſſue when they would, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>When the horſe was fully made, and the thouſand knights therein, by the counſel of Criſis, they prayed the king Priamus that he woulde ſuffer this horſe to enter into the cittie, and that it might be ſet in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Pallas, foraſmuch as they ſaide that they had made it in the honour of Pallas, for a vowe that they had made for reſtitution of the Palladium which they had cauſed to be taken out of the ſame temple, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Among theſe things the Princes that were yet in Troy, when they ſaw that the king had ſo fowly and ſo ſhamefully treated with the Gréekes, they went out of Troy, and tooke their men with them, and the king Philomenus led no more but two hundred and fifty men and thréeſcore maidens of Amazonne that were left of a thouſand that came with the Quéene Pentheſilea, and carried the bodie of her with them, and trauelled ſo long that in the ende they came vnto their owne Countrey.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="573" facs="tcp:7118:293"/>Then came the day that the Gréekes ſhould ſweare the peace fainedly vpon the plaine field vpon the ſanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries. King Priamus iſſued out of the cittie and his people, and ſware there each partie to holde the peace firmely from thence foorth on: and Diomedes ſwore firſt for the Gréekes: after, when they had broken the peace that they had treated with Anthenor of that thing that they concluded after, &amp; therefore they maintained, that they were not forſworne by that colour, as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerb ſayth, He that ſweareth by a cautele or maliciouſly, he by malice forſweareth himſelf. After that Diomedes ſware likewiſe all the kings and princes of Gréece, and then the king Priamus and the Troyans ſwore in good faith, as they that knew nothing of the great treaſon: and after their othes thus made, king Priamus deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Helene to Menelaus her huſband, and prayed him and other kings and princes of Gréece, that they would pardon Helen, without ſuffering to be done to her any iniury or hurt: and they promiſed him fainedly, that they would doe to her no wrong.</p>
                     <p>Then prayed the Gréekes, that they might ſet the horſe of braſſe within the Temple of Pallas, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Palladium, to the end that the goddeſſe Pal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>las might be to them friendly, in their returne. And as the king Priamus anſwered not therto, Eneas and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenor ſaid to him, that it ſhould be wel done, and that it ſhould be honour to the cittie. Howbeit the king Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amus accorded it with euill will. Then the Greekes receiued the golde and ſiluer, and the wheate that was promiſed them, and ſent it, and put into their ſhippes. After theſe things they went all in maner of proceſſion, and in deuotion with their prieſts, and beganne with ſtrength of cordes, to draw the horſe of braſſe vnto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the gate of the citie, and foraſmuch as by the gate it might not enter into the cittie, it was ſo great: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they brake the wall of the city in length and height,
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:7118:294"/>
in ſuch wiſe as it entred within the towne, &amp; the Troy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans receiued it with great ioy, but the cuſtome of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune is ſuch, that great ioy endeth in heauineſſe, and in ſorrow. The Troyans made ioy of this horſe, wherein was cloſed their death, and they knew nothing of it. In this horſe was a ſubtile man named Sinon, that bare the keies of the horſe, for to open it. When the Troyans were a ſleepe, and reſted them in the night, forthwith they iſſued out of the horſe, and gaue a token of fire to them that were in the fieldes, to the end that they ſhould come into the Citie, for to put it all to deſtruction.</p>
                     <p>The ſame day the Greekes fained to go vnto Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and ſaid, that they would receiue Helene, and ſette her in ſafetie, becauſe that the people ſhould not run vpon her, for the great euilles and hurtes that were fallen for her, and thus they departed from the porte of Troy with their ſailes drawne vp, and came before the ſunne going downe, to Tenedon. Then had the Troyans great ioy when they ſawe the Greekes depart, and they ſupped that euening with great gladneſſe: and the Greekes ſo ſoone as they were come to Tenedon, they armed them in the euening, and went ſtilly &amp; priuily toward Troy. When the Troyans had well ſupped, they we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to bed for to ſleepe. Then Sinon opened the horſe, and went out and light this fire, and ſhewed it to them that were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and anon without delay, they that were in a waite, entered into the Citie by the gate that was broken for to bring in the horſe of braſſe. And the thouſand knightes iſſued out, and where they found the Troyans they ſlew them in their houſes, where they ſlept as they that thought nothing.</p>
                     <p>Thus entred the Greekes into the Citie, and ſlewe men, women and children, without ſparing of any, and tooke all that they found in their houſes, and ſlew ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie ere it was day, that they had ſlaine more then twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie thouſand. They pilled and robbed the Temples, and
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:7118:294"/>
the cry aroſe to be horrible of them that they ſlew. When the king Priamus heard the cry (hee knew anon that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas and Anthenor had betraied him) he aroſe then ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtily and went into his temple of Apollo, that was within his Pallace, as he that had no more truſt nor hope of his life, and kneeled before the high altar. Caſſandra fled on the other ſide, as one that had been out of her witte, into the temple of Minerue, weeping and demeaning great ſorrowe: and the other noble women abode ſtill in the Pallace, in weepinges and in teares.</p>
                     <p>When it came to the morrow, the Greekes (by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Eneas and of Anthenor that were open tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours vnto their Citie, and alſo to their king and Lord) came and entered into the Pallace of Ilion, where they found no defence, &amp; put to death all them that they found. Then Pirrhus entred into the temple of Apollo, &amp; found there the king Priamus abiding his death: then he ranne vpon him with a naked ſword (in ſight of Eneas and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenor that guided him) he ſlew there the king Priamus before the high altar, which was all be-bled with his bloud. The queene Hecuba and Polixene fled, and wiſt not whether to go: and it happened that ſhe met with E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas, and then ſaid Hecuba to him in a great furie, Ha, a, felon traitour, from whence is come to thee ſo great crueltie, that thou haſt brought with thee them that haue ſlaine the king Priamus, that hath done to thee ſo much good, and hath ſet thee in magnificence, and alſo haſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traied the countrey where thou were borne, and the citie that thou oughteſt to keepe: at the leaſt let it ſuffiſe thée, and refraine thee now of thine intent, and haue pitie of this vnhappie Polixene: to the end that among ſo many euilles as thou haſt done, thou maieſt haue grace to haue done one good deede, as for to ſaue her from death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Greekes ſlea her. Eneas (mooued with Pitie) receiued Polixene in his guard, and put her in a ſecret place.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="576" facs="tcp:7118:295"/>Among theſe things king Thelamon ſet in the temple of Minerue in kéeping Andromeda the wife of Hector &amp; Caſſandra, whom he found there in Ilion, and ſet the cittie on fire in all places, and brent al the noble cittie, except onely the houſes of the traitors, which were kept and reſerued. When the cittie of Troy was all brent, king Agamemnon aſſembled al the moſt noble of Gréece in the temple of Minerue: and when they were all aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, he required them of two things: one was, that they ſhould hold their faith and trueth to the traitours: the other, that they ſhould take good aduiſe to part the prey of the cittie. The anſwer of the Gréekes was ſuch that they would hold their faith to the traitors as for the firſt point: and as to the ſecond, euery man ſhould bring all the prey in common, and there to part to ech man af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his merite and deſert. Then ſpake Thelamon and ſaid, they ſhould burne Helen, for whom ſo much hurt and euill was come, and that ſo many woorthy kings &amp; princes had died for. And there was a great murmure hereupon, that with great paine Agamemnon, Vlyſſes, and Menelaus might ſaue her. But Vlyſſes with his faire ſpéech ſaide to them ſo much of diuerſe things, that they were content that Helene ſhould haue no harme. And then Agamemnon did ſo much to all the other, that for his reward, the daughter of king Priamus Caſſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dra was deliuered vnto him. Whileſt that the Gréekes held yet their parliament, there came to them Eneas and Anthenor, and aduertiſed them howe Helenus had alway blamed the Troyans of the enterpriſe that they made againſt the Gréekes, and counſelled them to put the body of Achilles in ſepulture, which they woulde haue giuen to the houndes, and beſought them therefore that they would ſaue his life, and it was agréed and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded to them. And then Andromeda and Helenus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated for the two ſonnes of Hector, which were ſaued, albeit that Pirrhus was there againſt, and debated it
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:7118:295"/>
a litle, but in the end hee agreed it, and ſo the children were ſaued.</p>
                     <p>After this vproare they ordeined that all the noble women that were eſcaped from death, ſhould go whither they would freely, or dwell there ſtill, if it pleaſed them. And after theſe thinges done, they purpoſed to depart from Troy: but a great tempeſt beganne to ariſe that time that endured a moneth whole before they might go to the ſea. Then demaunded the Greeks of Calcas the cauſe of this trouble that endured ſo long? and hee aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that the puiſſances infernals were not yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed for the effuſion of the bloud of Achilles, that was ſhed in the temple of Apollo, for the loue of Polixene: and for to appeaſe the Gods, it behooued to ſacrifice Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixene, for whom Achilles died.</p>
                     <p>Then Pirrhus enquired diligently where Polixene was become, that was cauſe of the death of his father, for there was no tidings whither ſhe was aliue or dead? Agamemnon demanded of Anthenor: which ſaid to him, that he knew not where ſhe was, wherof he lied not: and yet for to make an end of all his euilles, he enquired ſo much that Polixene was found in priſon in an olde aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient tower, whereas ſhe was put in, and then he went thither and drew her out by force by her armes, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented her vnto the king Agamemnon, which anon ſent her to Pirrhus, the which ſent her to the ſepulture of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chilles for to be ſlaine: and as they led her, there was no king nor prince but that he had great ſorrow, for to ſee ſo faire a figure of a woman to be loſt, and without that ſhe had deſerued it, and they had deliuered her from the hand of Pirrhus, if Calcas had not been, that ſaid alway, that the tempeſt ſhould not ceaſe vnto the time that ſhe were dead.</p>
                     <p>When the faire Polixene was before the ſepulture of Achilles, ſhe excuſed her verie humbly of the death of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chilles, and ſaid, that ſhee was much wroth and ſory of
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:7118:296"/>
his death, and that the kinges and princes of Greece ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered her to die againſt iuſtice, and without fault or treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe: yet that ſhe had leauer haue the death then to liue with them that had taken away and ſlain al her friends. And when ſhee had finiſhed her wordes, Pirrhus ſmote her with his ſword (in ſight of the queene her mother) and ſlew her cruelly, and cut her all in peeces, and caſt them all about the ſepulture of his father. When Hecuba the queene ſawe thus her faire daughter ſlaine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhee fell downe in a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Among theſe things, the Gréekes reproched Eneas, that he had falſified his othe, in that that he had hid Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xene: and for this cauſe they baniſhed him out of Troy for euer. And when Eneas ſaw that he might not abide there, hee prayed them earneſtly that they would accord and agree that hee might haue the two and twentie
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:7118:297"/>
ſhippes that Paris had with him into Gréece, and they graunted to him his requeſt, and gaue vnto him foure monethes ſpace for to repaire them, and furniſh them of all ſuch neceſſaries that they lacked. Anthenor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted after from Troy with his good will, and led with him a great number of Troyans: but the hiſtory telleth not whither he would go. Eneas greately hated Anthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, forſomuch as by him hee was baniſhed out of Troy: and was in great ſorrow, becauſe Anthenor was not as well baniſhed as he. And for this cauſe Eneas aſſembled all the Troyans, and ſaide to them: my friendes, and my brethren, ſince that Fortune hath put vs in the ſtate wherein we be, we may not liue without a head and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour: and if ye will doe by counſell, ye ſhall chooſe Anthenor, and make him your king, for he is wiſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to gouerne you. This counſell ſéemed good to the Troyans, and they ſent after Anthenor that returned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>none vnto them: and as ſoone as he was come, Eneas aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled a great number of people for to runne vpon him, as he that was moſt mighty in Troy. Then the Troy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans prayed him that he would ceaſe, ſince that the warre was finiſhed, and that he would not beginne it againe. How (ſaide Eneas) ſhoulde wee ſpare one ſo hainous a traitour, that by his great villany hath cauſed Polixene the faire daughter of king Priamus to die, and by him I am baniſhed out of Troy, that ſhould haue counſelled and holpen you: and now I muſt néedes leaue you? E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas ſaide ſo much to the Troyans, that they banniſhed Anthenor for euer out of Troy, and conſtrained him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>none to goe his way out of the towne, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Anthenor entred into the ſea with a great company of Troyans, and ſailed ſo farre that he fell among men of war and pirates of the ſea, who ranne vpon him and ſlew many of his men, and hurt and robbed and pilled of his ſhips: and in the end Anthenor eſcaped from them, and ſailed ſo farre that he arriued in a Prouince named
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:7118:298"/>
Gerbandy, wherof the king Tetides was lord and king, a iuſt man and a courteous. In this land arriued Anthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor with a few ſhippes, and reſted on the ſide of a greater Ile, that was nigh vnto the port. He ſaw the countrey faire and full of woodes and of land, and of fountaines, and there he builded a citie to him and to his people, and fortified it with walles and good towres. And when the Troians knew thereof, many went thither and dwelled there with Anthenor, and the citie grew apace, and was full of people, and Anthenor gouerned him ſo wiſely in this land, that he was well in the grace of the king Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tides, and was the ſecond after the king in his realme: and named his citie Cortiremetralum.</p>
                     <p>Caſſandra that was left at Troy, had great ſorrow for the great miſchiefes that were fallen to her friends: and ceaſed not to weepe and waile: and when ſhee hadde de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaned long her ſorrow: the Greekes demaunded her of their eſtate in their returning home: of which ſhe ſaide to them, that they ſhould ſuffer many paines and great perils ere they wer come into their countrey: and after ſhe ſaid to Agamemnon, that they of his owne houſe ſhoulde ſlea him. So it happened to him after, and to all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, like as Caſſandra had deuiſed to them and ſaid. Of the king Thelamon were left two ſons, of two quéenes, the eldeſt was named Hermicides of the queen Glauſta: and the other of the queene Thymiſſa had to name An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſatus: theſe two children nouriſhed the king Theu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter til they were great to beare armes.</p>
                     <p>Among theſe thinges Agamemnon and Menelaus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded leaue for to returne into their landes: and the moſt great of the hoſte gaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> leaue, being ſore vexed, foraſmuch as they had been taken as ſuſpect of the death of Thelamon, with Vliſſes which was ſtollen away like a theefe, wherefore he ſhewed well, that he was culpable of the death. Thus theſe two brethren put them to the fea for to returne home, and in the entrie of the Winter,
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:7118:298"/>
when the ſea is moſt daungerous, anon after the other Greekes entered into the Sea, as fooles and euill adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for the doubtes of the Sea, and had their ſhippes all charged and laden with the richeſſe, whereof they hadde ſpoiled the riche citie and realme of Troy: and for the great deſire that they had for to be at home in their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, they beganne to returne thus in the middes of the Winter, and ſet apart all daungers and perilles, which fell vnto them. About the houre of noone, came a great tempeſt, and ſurpriſed them ſodainly, with great thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and raine, with winde and with great waues of the ſea that caſted their ſhippes heere and there in the ſea: and brake their maſtes, and all to rent their ſailes. And when the night came, which was long and darke, the ſhippes left each other in ſayling before the winde, ſome in one place, and ſome in another, and many were burnt with lightening and thunder that fell vpon them, and many were drowned and ſunke into the Sea: and they that were therein were dead and drowned, and the great riches of Troy loſt. Oyleus Aiax that had xxxii. ſhippes in this companie, had all his ſhips burnt and periſhed, and he himſelfe by the force of his armes and legges all naked ſwimming came and arriued a land, all ſwollen with the water that hee had drunken, and lay a great while vpon the grauel, more looking for death then life: and anon after came other in likewiſe, that were ſo ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with ſwimming, which were diſcomforted in their miſhap and vnhappineſſe. This miſchiefe came to this Aiax, foraſmuch as he drew Caſſandra out of the temple of Minerue. And it happeneth oft time, that many be puniſhed for the ſin and treſpaſſe of one man, &amp;c.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XXVIII. ¶How the king Naulus and Cetus his ſonne did ſpoile on the ſea manie ſhippes of the Greeks, in their return for the death of his ſonne Palamedes, and of the death of the king Agamemnon, and of the exile of Diome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, and of his calling backe by Egee his wife, &amp;c.</head>
                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this time there was a king in Gréece named Naulus that was very riche and puiſſant, and his realme ſtood vpon the ſide of the Sea of Greece toward the South. In the which Sea were great rockes and high, and many mountaines and hilles of ſand which were right perillous. The king was father of Palamedes, that was ſlain before Troy, and hadde yet a ſonne named Cetus: there was none in Gréece ſo rich, nor ſo puiſſant a king.</p>
                     <p>Nowe were there ſome euill people there that coulde not be in eaſe without greeuing and annoying of other, which made the ſaid king Naulus to vnderſtand, and his ſon king Cetus, that Palamedes was not ſlain in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, ſo as the voice ranne, but hee was ſlaine couertly by Vliſſes and Diomedes. Agamemnon and Menelaus had made and contriued a falſe letter, wherein was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained that Palamedes would haue betraied the hoſte of the Greekes, whiles he was emperour of the hoſte, for a great quantitie of gold: and they made this letter to bée put by the ſide of a knight that was ſlaine. And then V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſſes treated in ſuch wiſe with one of the ſecretaries of Palamedes, for a great ſumme of money, ſuch as the Letters contained: and this Secretarie by the induc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Vliſſes put this ſumme of mony vnder the head of
<pb n="585" facs="tcp:7118:299"/>
Palamedes whiles he ſlept. And as ſoone as the ſecreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie had ſaid to Vliſſes that he had done: then Vliſſes ſlew this Secretary priuily, and forthwith did ſo much that this letter came into the handes of the Greeks, that read it, and were all abaſhed when they ſaw in writing the treaſon, and the ſumme contained in the ſame laide vnder his head. They went then into his tent, and found the trueth of this thing, and woulde haue runne vppon Palamedes: but he offered himſelfe to defend it againſt whom ſoeuer woulde prooue it: and ſo there was none that durſt fight againſt him. Then Vliſſes did ſo much by his faire language, that this thing was appeaſed: and it ſeemed that it was beſt that Palamedes ſhould abide in his dignitie.</p>
                     <p>After this thing thus appeaſed, Vliſſes and Diome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des on a day did Palamedes to vnderſtand, that they knew a pit, wherein was much treaſure, and that they would that he hadde his part: and that hee ſhould go the night following. When the night was come, they went all three alone without more company, and there offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Palamedes for to go down into the pit firſt, and they ſaid, that they woulde followe: and aſſoone as hee was within, the other two caſt ſtones vpon him ſo many, that they ſlew him, and after returned to their tentes priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. This thing ſaid, theſe men charged king Naulus, and Cetus of the death of Palamedes: and all was falſe. Then the king and his ſonne began earneſtly to thinke how they might auenge them of the Greekes. They knew well that the Greekes were vppon returne in the heart of the Winter: and that they muſt paſſe by his realme. And then the king Naulus did crie in all his realme, that men ſhoulde make great fires euery night vpon the mountains that ſtood by the ſea ſide. And this did he to the end, that when the Greekes ſhoulde ſee the fire by night they ſhoulde come thither, weening to finde good hauen: and if they came, they ſhould find hard
<pb n="586" facs="tcp:7118:300"/>
rocks and mountaines of ſand. And ſo they ſhoulde not eſcape without death. It was thus done, as Naulus had deuiſed, there were nigh two hundreth ſhips of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gréeks broken againſt the rocks: and all they that were therein were drowned. When the other ſhippes that followed them heard the noyſe of the ſhippes that ſo were broken, and the c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>e of them that were drowned, they turned on the other boord, and made to ſeawarde, and ſaued them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. Of them that eſcaped, were Agamemnon, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelaus, Diomedes, and ſome other that ſhall bee named hereafter.</p>
                     <p>Cetus, that otherwiſe was called Pellus, had great ſorrow, when hee knew that Agamemnon was eſcaped: and then he thought long, how he might auenge himſelf. When hee was come home, and was ariued in his owne land, he wrote a letter to Clitemneſtra the wife of Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memnon: and this letter conteined, that for certaine A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamemnon her huſbande had eſpouſed one of the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of king Priamus, and that he loued her greatly, and brought her with him into his countrey for to make her Quéene, and to put out Clitemneſtra, or to ſlay her: and therefore Cetus aduertiſed her, to the end that ſhe might prouide for her ſelfe. Clitemneſtra anon beléeued theſe letters, and thanked Cetus enough, and thought that ſhe would auenge her of her huſband. This Clitemneſtra, in the abſence of her huſband, loued a man named Egiſtus, by whom ſhe had a daughter named Erigona: ſhe loued more her loue Egiſtus, then euer ſhee did her huſband, though he was come of lowe bloud. But it is the cuſtom of a woman that doth amiſſe, to take one to her of leſſe value than her huſband is. Shée had treated with Egi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus, that the firſt night that Agamemnon ſhoulde lie with her, he ſhould runne vpon him and ſlea him. This thing was done in like manner as ſhée had purpoſed: and Agamemnon was ſlaine, and laide in the earth: and anone after, Clytemneſtra tooke to huſband her loue
<pb n="587" facs="tcp:7118:300"/>
Egiſtus king of Michmas.</p>
                     <p>Agamemnon thus ſlaine, had a ſonne of this Clytem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtra that was named Horeſtes, a yong childe, which Calcibus his couſine had in kéeping, and tooke him from his mother, to the end that ſhe ſhould not ſlea him: and after ſent him to the king of Créete Idumeus that was his vncle. And he had great ioy of him: and ſo had his wife Tharaſis alſo, that loued him as much as Clytem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtra her daughter, that had no more children but her, and ſhe was a faire yong maide. Thus as Cetus had written to Clytemneſtra the wife of Agamemnon, in like manner he wrote to the wife of Diomedes named Egée, who was daughter of the king Polimites of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimens, and ſiſter of Aſſandrus, that returned from Troy with Diomedes his brother in lawe. So it happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in their returning, that they went into the land of king Thelephus, which was euil content, and went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them with a great company of men of armes, and aſſailed them: and they defended them ſtrongly. And Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſandrus ſlew many of the knightes of Thelephus, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he had great ſorrow and was angry, and tooke a great ſpeare, &amp; addreſſed him againſt Aſſandrus with ſo great force, that he ſmote him to the earth, and ſlew him. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omedes, to auenge the death of his brother in law, ſlewe many knightes of Thelephus, and recouered the bodie of Aſſandrus with great trouble and paine, and bare it into his ſhippe.</p>
                     <p>Thus died Aſſandrus, but it was not ſo reported to Egée his ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ter: but it was tolde her, that Diomedes her huſband had ſlaine him, to haue all the ſeignorie of Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens, whereof Aſſandrus had the one halfe againſt his ſiſter Egée. Of theſe tidings, and of them that Cetus had written, Egée was angry with Diomedes her huſband, &amp; wrought ſo with her people, that they promiſed her they would no more receiue Diomedes for their lord. Thus when Diomedes returned, his wife ne his folk would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:7118:301"/>
him, but baniſhed him out of the countrey of Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens for euer. Then happened he to arriue in Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, where king Theuter brother of king Thelamon was. This king heard ſay, that Diomedes was culpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the death of his brother, with Vlyſſes: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon he commaunded that Diomedes ſhoulde be taken. But Diomedes hearing thereof, fledde thence. King Demophon, and king Athamas being arriued in their landes, were baniſhed by ſemblable manner. Then ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued they in the land of Duke Neſtor, which receiued them with great ioy. Theſe two kings purpoſed to goe into their lands with men of armes, and take vengeance on their people. But Duke Neſtor blamed them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: and counſelled them that they ſhould firſt ſend to them to admoniſh them to receiue them for their Lords, and promiſe to them great franchiſes and liberties. Thus did they as Neſtor had counſelled them: and it was not long after, but that their people receiued them, as aforeſaid.</p>
                     <p>While Eneas abode in Troy to repaire his ſhippes, he indured many aſſaults of his neighbours, that would haue taken as a prey all the remnant of the Troyans. And foraſmuch as he might not abide there longer then his terme aſſigned vnto him by the Gréekes: he aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the Troyans, and councelled them that they ſhould ſend and ſéeke Diomedes to be their king, and ſaid vnto them, he would come willingly, foraſmuch as he was driuen out of his countrey: and he was both wiſe and valiant. So they ſent for to ſéeke Diomedes, and found him: who came foorthwith, and found the Troyans beſieged by their neighbour nations, Eneas then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the battel: in which Diomedes bare himſelfe ſo valiantly that he tooke away priſoners, and hanged ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as théeues. In the fift battell he behaued himſelfe ſo, that he gat the vpper hand altogither of his ennemies, and conquered them all: ſo as there were none of his
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:7118:301"/>
neighbours that durſt aſſaile the Troyans.</p>
                     <p>During theſe things the nauie of Eneas was ready, wherevpon he tooke ſhipping with Anchiſes his father: and being at ſea, they reſolued to go and ſeeke an habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion where the gods and fortune would aſſigne. During their aduentures at ſea many perils happened, and ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing at randon this way and that way, they ſayled by Helleſpont, and thence paſſing arriued at Tuſkane in I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talie: from whence ſayling they came to Carthage, and thence againe to Italie. The ſtorie whereof who lift to peruſe, let him reade Virgil. When Egea the wife of Diomedes knew that the Troyans had intertained Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omedes, and that he had diſcomfited their ennemies, ſhée doubted that Diomedes would alſo take vengeaunce on her. Then ſhe councelled with her people, and by their aduiſe ſhe ſent for him to come vnto her: who came with a good will, and had good intertainement, In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner did ſundry Lordes that had béene exiled, returne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to their wiues and houſes, and enioyed their olde ſeigniories, as many as had eſcaped the daunger of the ſea.</p>

Then Horeſtes prayed him that he would
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:7118:302"/>
helpe him with his people to be auenged of the death of his father, and to recouer his land againe. Whereupon Idumeus deliuered to him a thouſand armed men wiſe and hardie. And Horeſtes gathered out of other places an other thouſand: ſo paſſing toward Michmas he went by Traſim, where Forenſis was Lorde and gouernour, of whome he gat a hundred ſouldiers: this did Forenſis for the hatred that he bare to Egiſtus, foraſmuch as the ſaide Egiſtus hauing eſpouſed his daughter, forſooke her for the loue of Clitemneſtra. So he ioynd with Horeſtes to make war againſt Egiſtus. This expedition was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in hand at the beginning of the moneth of Mate. When they came before Michmas, thoſe that kept the cittie would not yéelde it. He then beſieged it round: for Horeſtes had aunſwere from the gods, that hée ſhould be auenged of his mother with his owne handes, albeit that ſhe was faſt cloſed within that fortified cittie. Egi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus was not al this time within the citie, but was gone to procure aide and ſuccours of men of warre from other places, againſt the comming of Horeſtes his enemy, by the inſtigation of his wife Clytemneſtra.</p>

                        <pb n="591" facs="tcp:7118:302"/>On the morrowe after Horeſtes cauſed his mother Clytemneſtra to bee brought before him ſtarke naked, with her handes bounde, whome as ſoone as euer hee ſawe, hee ranne at her with his naked ſworde, and firſt hee cutte off her twoo pappes, and after ſlew her, and cauſed her body to be drawen into the fieldes, and there to be left for dogges and the birds of the ayre to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure. Then he made Egiſtus to be taken and ſtripped, and to be drawen naked thorough the citie, and after to be hanged. And in like ſort dealt he with thoſe that were found to haue béene culpable of his fathers death. This vengeance tooke Horeſtes for the death of good king A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamemnon his father.</p>
                     <p>Menelaus after ſundry great perilles by ſea, at length arriued in Créete, hauing with him Helene his wife: who hearing of the death of his brother, and how cruelly Horeſtes had putte his owne mother to the death, was ſore diſpleaſed with his nephew. At that ſame time came to Menelaus all the greateſt Lordes and Nobles of Gréece, for whoſe ſake all the Gréekes had ſuffered ſo much trouble and vexation. From Créete Menelaus ſailed to Michmas, and tolde Horeſtes, that he was not woorthy to be king or gouernour, for that he had ſo cruelly put to death his owne mother. Whereuppon Menelaus aſſembled at Athens all the chiefe nobles of Gréece, to the end to depriue Horeſtes of his raigne and gouernement, for the tyrannous murthering of his mother. Horeſtes excuſed himſelfe thereof, ſaying, the gods had appointed him to doe that which hee hadde done.</p>
                     <p>At this the duke of Athens roſe vp, and offered to bée champion in maintaining Horeſtes his cauſe gainſt any that would withſtand it, by combate or otherwiſe: which challenge of his being by no man accepted, Horeſtes was iudged guiltleſſe, and was ſuffered ſtill to enioy his kingdome. But vpon this quarrell Horeſtes conceiued

ſuch mortall hatred againſt Menelaus his vncle, that hée afterward bare great euill wil to him. Notwithſtanding king Idumeus came within a while to Michmas, and ſo reconciled them each to other, that Horeſtes tooke to wife Hermione the daughter of king Menelaus and of Helen. Whereat Erigone the daughter of Egiſtus and of Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temneſtra had ſo great ſorrow, that ſhe hanged herſelfe, being gréeued that Horeſtes proſpered ſo well.</p>
                     <p>During theſe affaires, Vlyſſes came into Créete with two Marchants ſhippes, for he had loſt all his own ſhippes, and the chiefe of his goodes by rouers or pirates at the ſea. After which loſſe, hée arriued (by miſhappe) within the countrey of king Thelamon, where he loſt the reſidue of his goodes, and they of the countrey would haue hanged him, had it not béene, that by his witte and cunning he eſcaped their handes.

                     <p>AS <hi>Vliſſes</hi> was ſléeping on his bed, he ſaw a viſion, in which there ſéemed before him, a wonderfull fair creature, the moſt beautiful that ever he ſaw, which he would fain have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced, but the Image would not ſuffer him. And he going after it, the Image asked him, what he would have: he anſwered, that he was deſirous to joyne with it in carnal copulation. Then ſaid the Image: Oh, a woful conjunction will this be, for thereupon one of us muſt dye. Moreover, to him ſéemed, that the Image held a Spear, about the head was a penſil cunningly wrought all over with fiſhes. And to him ſéemed, that the Image depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted away and ſaid: this ſight betokneth deſtruction that ſhall happen to us two. When <hi>Vliſſes</hi> awaked, he was troubled to think of his dream, and being deſirous to know what it might ſignifie: he ſent unto the Soothſayers of his Realm, to enquire what this Viſion might preſage: who having conſidered thereof, ſaid: that his own Son ſhould kill him. Vpon this, he fearing his Son, cauſed him to be apprehended and ſurely kept. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward he made him to dwell in a Caſtle, that ſtood alone, where with a few of his truſty Friends and Servants, he ſpent the time: and this Caſtle none might come unto but thoſe few of his own retinue: and they not to paſſe or re-paſſe but at certain times, by a draw-bridge and a wicket, the Caſtle being watred round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout.

Governour, which was the cunningeſt woman in the world in inchantment.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Circe</hi> by her witchcraft made <hi>Vliſſes</hi> ſtay with her a time at his returne, and conceived by him a Son, whom ſhe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Thelagonus.</hi> And about the time of <hi>Vliſſes</hi> his dwelling in his Caſtle: <hi>Thelagonus</hi> being grown to ripe years, and being a ſtout young man, would néeds know of his Mother, who was his Father.

Hereupon the uproar grew more and more: and <hi>Vliſſes</hi> doubting it was his Son <hi>Thelamonius,</hi> who had broken out of priſon, came running out with a dart in his hand, which he flung at <hi>Thelagonus,</hi> and hit him, not knowing who he was, and hurt <hi>Thelagonus</hi> a little.</p>
